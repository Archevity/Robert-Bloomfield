                    to Robert Bloomfield, 29 May 1821<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p class="pnonident">Dear Sir</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Excuse me once more because I fear I have hardly quite made
                    myself understood.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Nothing could be more proper than your resolution made in 1800.                     Nothing can be more proper than that you should now adhere to it. I should
                    perhaps be as unwilling as you to enter into any 'disputation or disquisition'
                    on either religion or Politics—had you stated any opinions of yours, &amp;
                    had they differed from mine, it was my intention to have recommended to your
                    perusal the books on which mine had been formed, or by which they had been
                    confirmed, but I think nothing should have induced me to have gone further.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am sure of the truth of what I said in my last—viz that the
                    opinions which I there stated have occasioned you the loss of some valuable
                    friends. I must decline mentioning their names or the sources of my information.
                    If without stating what your opinions on either subject are you will merely say
                    that they are not hostile to the Church or Government of this country as each
                    now exists, I am inclined to hope that something may yet be done for you, but my
                    Dear Sir you must be aware that it would be highly wrong in any person who is
                    contented with the blessings he enjoys, &amp; is willing to defend them, if
                    necessary, with his life, to associate with, &amp; to give countenance to a
                    man whom he knows to be desirous of depriving him of them. I even yet hope you
                    are not among these, &amp; if so it seems to me impossible that you should
                    not be able easily to convince your friends who are unwilling to believe the
                    contrary, that you are not so I regret with you that opinions should be so often
                    formed without sufficient information, but when certain facts are known
                    &amp; others withheld, it is impossible it should be otherwise. It is with a
                    view of obtaining the remainder of this information &amp; of applying it to
                    your use that I am giving you this trouble. You will give me such an answer as
                    your own good sense shall point out as most likely to answer this end.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I remain Dear Sir</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> yours Truly</p>

     be surrounded by abrupt and woody hills, except on the north, where a bold promontory, with an
     old camp on its brow, calld the 'Berry,'<span id="Note2_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note2"><sup>2</sup></a> lifts its
     bald head; and whose sides, yielding plenty of stone for building, are extremly steep. Yet they
     are not hills, but merely the terminations of the upland country of Gloucestershire termed the
     'Cotswold Levels' and here they break suddenly into the vale of the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Severn" title="Severn">Severn</a>:<span id="Note3_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the valley of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley" title="Uley">Uley</a> is sunk so

     him. Cotswold is an immense Gloucester cheese, and <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley" title="Uley">Uley</a>

     first I had ever seen), which, in its further progress, becomes of such importance to the
     clothiers. The Curate of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley" title="Uley">Uley</a> preaches here once a
     fortnight, and he lately ran the hazard of his life by the falling of the sounding-board, which
     struck him a violent blow on the head.— The country immediately round this valley on the high
     ground, is every where intersected by stone walls; for stone, a brick thickness, more or less,
     is the invariable consequence of digging ten inches into the ground; they are merely piled,
     without morter, easily made, and as easily mended. A strange desolate appearance! In the valley
     there is no such thing. The verdure is of the most vivid green, and the uneven boundary of
     woods on the allmost perpendicular sides of the high grounds, form the finest amphitheatre I
     have ever seen. But hold! I am going down the Wye! </p>

     lowlands fall with a slow, gradual descent; The passage-house is finely situated, and the boats
     are fitted up for the conveying horses and carriages across the stream. The water of the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Severn" title="Severn">Severn</a> is here but narrow, but owing to the occasional tides
     of uncommon height, the sands are extensive; the current is rapid. Barrow Hill is a charming
     spot, rising in the neck of a horseshoe form'd by the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Severn" title="Severn">Severn</a>, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> gives</span> &lt;giving&gt; a great

     pebbles, which in the neighbourhood of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley" title="Uley">Uley</a> are not seen,
     nor the least appearance of chalk, or flint. Horses, I observe, appear to be struck with a kind
     of tremulous submission on finding themselves floating; one Barge carried the seven. But to
     float each sociable, two barges were lash'd side by side, and the carriage placed across upon
     planks. One Boat of course carried all the party, and we were soon all on terrey-firma again,

     bold eminence on the left, cloathd with wood, with a range, or strata of Rock breaking through
     it, and forming a curious contrast with the green above and below. Penyard Hill, in the
     neighbourhood of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RossOnWye" title="Ross">Ross</a>, is nearly of the same
     description, but is on every side covered by steep woods, so that they assert that no sparrows
     were ever known on the farm on its brow; This I think possible, as the sparrow is so entirely
     domestic, and avoids woods in general; and in this case his flight would be unusually long, and
     almost perpendicular.</p>

     of dreary look to one unused to such buildings. The church, with its taper spire, stands on
     elevated ground, and from &lt;it&gt; is a view of the River Wye winding eel-fashion, below.

     a vehicle of sufficient importance. My heart is brimfull of indescribable pleasure when I think
     on this day! Beauty in all its variety is perhaps its leading feature, But sublimity is

     cascades, but rapids, where the water hurries along with a <em>visible</em> descent. It is
     winding in its course to a great degree, inconceivably pelucid, and in general, the hills rise

     called '<a class="link_ref" href="places.html#SymondsYat" title="Symmons' Yat">Symmons' Yat</a>' obtrudes itself to a vast
     height between the two points of the approach of the river. Instead of going round with the
     boat, it is usual for the party to ascend the rocks from A to B where the ridge terminates in a
     high bank of perpendicular Rock not more than twenty yards wide, and to join the boat again at
      <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#NewWeir" title="new Wier">new Wier</a>. An old woman was our guide, who led us over
     this isthmus untill our bones ached.—Three of us outstript our companions, and finding they did
     not overtake us, I again left my two companions, and climbd a pathless way, with intent to
     reach the summit which I had missd. On nearly approaching the absolute perpendicular part of
     the cliff, I heard voices at the top, and hallow'd and soon found &lt;that&gt; the hindmost
     part of the company, had climbed the place before me. The old woman descended to become my
     pilot, and the view paid amply for the labour. On the down-stream side of this bank of rock
     lies the place called the '<a class="link_ref" href="places.html#NewWeir" title="New Wier">New Wier</a>,' or a kind of
     artificial means of keeping up the river, and accommodated by a lock. here we embarkd again,

     this rocky hill, stands allmost detachd, an upright tower of stone very aptly term'd the

     describe all the beauties of the passage was not my intention was I ever so capable. There was
     one circumstance however that was to me curious. I had heard when at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RossOnWye" title="Ross">Ross</a>, that the fishermen on this River, still used the
     identical kind of boat which Caesar has described in his commentaries<span id="Note12_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note12"><sup>12</sup></a> as being used in his
     time by the natives of Britain, and I hoped for an opportunity of being convinced of its truth.

     among some fishermen who were disturbing the water with long poles to dislodge the salmon. To
     accomplish this they occasionally used an infant kind of boat, which they carry with them in
     their large one. It holds but one person; is, as far as I can guess not more than 4 foot in
     length, goes with the broadest end foremost, is worked by a paddle, has no keel or rudder, and
     is formd of wickers only, and cover'd by an oil-skin outside to repel the water. The man
     paddles himself on shore, jumps out, and takes his boat at his back with great ease. It had a
     strange and even laughable appearance; It was impossible to keep the mind at home; it would
     compare infancy and maturity, a 'Corricle' or 'Corracal' with the 'Victory,'<span id="Note13_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note13"><sup>13</sup></a> and a Wye fisherman to Nelson.<span id="Note14_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

     on the top of the wall of course. This gangway, once the place of the defenders of the fortress

     and fragments allmost to the summit, where the poor animal trembled and neigh'd for his

     servants relieved each other in the necessary duty of holding the horses, and enjoy'd the scene
     by turns. —— We all sat on the soft green, or rather brown heath or Ling; and from a spring
     just below the rocky summit had some excellent water. From this sublime eminence the eye ranges
     over others still higher, and the &lt;blue mists hanging over the horizon, gave to the&gt; long
     line of intersecting mountains the appearance of a sea of hills. We had left beauty behind,
     here was nothing but sublimity! and I think that mirth would be the last feeling likely to be
     excited in such a situation. The air was remarkably fresh and invigorating; some few drops of
     rain fell, which were most likely not known in the country below. We left the summit with
     regret. At a considerable way from the more rocky part of the hill, in our descent, a cloth was
     spread on the moss beside a rivulet, the horses tied to a thorn, and the cold <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">collation</span> &lt;repast&gt; enjoy'd with a mutual
     thankfulness, that is seldom found in a hall amidst the clattering of knives and plates. Again
     &lt;we mounted&gt; the Welsh sociable, and descended by another road, though as to declivity
     not a whit better than the other. We at length reachd the turnpike road to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Abergavenny" title="Abergany">Abergany</a>, and returnd to the Inn after an excursion
     that having been long promised and expected, could hardly have been despensed with, and which

     ingredient in dish of our pleasures. </p>

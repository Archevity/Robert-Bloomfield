    </p>
    <p class="pnonident">ART. IV—The Banks of the Wye, a Poem, in four Books. By Robert Bloomfield, Author of the
     Farmer's Boy. London, Vernor and Co. and others, 1811. 12mo. pp. 134. price 5s. Plates.</p>
    <p class="pnonident"> PERHAPS it may be said, observes Mr. Bloomfield, that because much of public approbation has
     fallen to my lot, it may be unwise to venture again. If Mr. B. writes chiefly for emolument,
     this objection must <em xmlns="">cease</em>; if for reputation, we must unite ourselves to those who
     would impeach his wisdom on the present occasion. His poetical character, though widely
     blazoned by the trump of fame, is not of that very exalted nature to make experiment dangerous;
     there is nevertheless one consideration, which he should bear in mind; namely, that the public
     have a right, on hearing of a new poem from an author, who was a creature of their own, to
     expect a very visible improvement in those points, in which there were some deficiencies on a
     former occasion. To that public, and to those who introduced him to it, Mr. Bloomfield will be
     found wanting in due deference, should he be proved, now that he ventures upon a new poem—</p>
    <div class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Priori credere famæ.'</div>
    </div>
    <p class="pnonident"> A greater ease in composition is undoubtedly evident on the present occasion; but an
     increased intimacy with the machinery of poetry is another point, which might reasonably be
     expected. That Mr. B. does not in reality possess this, we are not prepared to assert; but that
     the present volume contains no symptoms of it, we are compelled to declare. The species of poem
     indeed before us, is such, as almost precludes the possibility of displaying any new lights in
     poetry, which the author may have acquired; but will not this very choice of style, and
     subject, be an argument to some minds, that the strength of that pinion, of which so much was
     prophesied, neither is nor will be able to rise nearer to the summit of Parnassus, than it did
     at its first essay? To no writers can the old Latin adage of 'non progredi est regredi' be
     applied with greater truth, than to those whose first popularity arose from the same
     combination of circumstances as those of the present author's; since those readers, who are
     disappointed in subsequent attempts, will begin to suspect that they augured too highly from
     the first. Having given this counsel to our author, which will, we trust, be received in the
     same spirit of justice, which has dictated it, we proceed to his poem. It is little else than a
     journal in easy rhyme of an excursion in South Wales, with occasional apostrophes to objects,
     which excited more than ordinary attention, and a few historical allusions, which were recalled
     to the memory of the places visited. The metre is that which Swift has recommended by his
     example for epistolary verse, a jingle of eight syllables, well adapted, by its natural
     carelessness, for a fable, a ballad, a burlesque, or a detail of common occurrences, but which
     has seldom proved equal to the task of conducting a reader through a poem of any length, where
     much description of scenery is attempted. Mr. Scott has indeed given an entirely new character
     and consequence to this verse; yet, notwithstanding the peculiar beauties in which he has
     clothed it, it has more than once been objected even against him. In Mr. Bloomfield's hands it
     has not the same merits, and wears much too great an air of familiarity with the reader, not
     unfrequently, as we shall see, degenerating into vulgarity.</p>
    <p class="indent1"> In the summer of 1807, some of the author's friends, resident in
     Gloucestershire, proposed this excursion, and included him in their party. The little tour
     occupied a fortnight: As Mr. B. had never before seen romantic scenery, the effect produced on
     his mind was proportionably greater. The route pursued was by descending the Wye from Ross to
     Chepstow, from which latter place an excursion was made into other parts of Monmouthshire, and
     the neighbouring county of Wales. On these materials the present poem is formed, and we would,
     by no means, have our readers leave us with the idea, that we conceive it devoid of merit. Its
     descriptions are faithful, the versification easy and natural; the thoughts, though seldom very
     original, fairly dressed out, and the plan remarkably inartificial. That the poet should not
     have chosen a subject, the formation of which required more machinery, we have regretted; but
     having chosen the present one, we approve of the simplicity of design in its execution. We will
     quote the author's farewell to the scenery of Monmouthshire as a very favourable specimen of
     his work.</p>

     <div class="indent3">Then vanish by some magic spell,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And shout "delicious Wye farewell."</div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent1"> We do not think that we could have selected a more favourable passage; it
     shows the lively fancy, and ready imagination of Mr. B. to some advantage. Nor is the following
     a bad simile for the singular bridge at Chepstow: </p>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Where the strange bridge, light, trembling, high,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Strides like a spider o'er the Wye.'</div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent1"> It is now time that we advert to the unpleasant part of our office, and
     justify the criticism, which we advanced, when we said, that the carelessness of the metre had
     betrayed the author into many vulgarities of language.</p>

     we presume, attached to the persuasion of the Quakers.</p>

     to recommend it.</p>

    <p class="pnonident">We are truly sorry that we could multiply these instances of bathos. In this conclusion of
     our article, we wish not to have our meaning mistaken, when we say, that we have felt some
     disapprobation, not only at the peculiar faults which we have noticed; but at opening a volume,
     which must rather depress than exalt the poetical character of its author. To the tourist on
     the Wye, it will be a pleasant companion; or to those, who recollect the scenes which are here
     delineated: to the lover of poetry, there are some things which will give pleasure; but to the
     observer of progressive genius, the work, as a whole, will bring a degree of disappointment.
     The 'Farmer's Boy' was a very extraordinary effort of unrefined genius; but like many other
     poems, it suffered unfairly from being praised too highly. There were however many, by whom its
     merits were justly appreciated. Bloomfield's minor poems, his tales, &amp;c. are, we think,
     very unequal to his first poem. Rural scenery is beyond all doubt his strong hold. He has
     judged well, then, we may be told, in continuing to offer us a poetic landscape. To this we can
     only reply, that by so doing he certainly shields himself from the risk of much critical
     censure; but, at the same time, he does not even attempt to mount one step higher on the ladder
     of fame. Numerous are the subjects and kinds of poetry, which, although not professedly
     descriptive of scenery, admit of it in due proportions; and we wish that Mr. B. had made some
     experiment of this nature. The present volume will, we fear, lead to the conclusion, unless he
     speedily contradicts it, that his muse possesses no capacity for the higher flights of
     imagination. There are a few plates, which, with the exception of the frontispiece, are
     tolerably executed.</p>

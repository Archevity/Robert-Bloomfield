       Castle, but in the eighteenth-century their principal seat was at Badminton House, Chipping
       Sodbury, Gloucestershire. From 1794 they, in conjunction with the 'Kymin Club' comprising
       local gentlemen, turned their land at Beaulieu woods and the Kymin, on the Wye near Monmouth,
       into a picturesque landscape with rides, a Round Tower equipped with telescopes which
       commanded views of nine counties, and a Naval Pavilion commemorating British victories.

       the Barons Grey de Wilton from the thirteenth century, when Reginald De Grey became its lord,
       to 1603 when the fifteenth Baron was attainted and his title forfeited. The castle then
       passed to Sir Reginald Egerton, 1st Baronet, by virtue of his marriage to the Baron's sister.
       In 1784 the hereditary title was revived when their descendant Sir Thomas Egerton, 7th
       Baronet, was created Baron Grey de Wilton of Wilton Castle. On his death in 1804, three years
       before Bloomfield passed the castle, the Barony of Grey de Wilton became extinct, there being

      <span class="gloss"> Anglican clergyman, amateur artist, tourist and theorist of
       the picturesque in his tour journals circulated in manuscript to friends including Thomas
       Gray. In 1782, Gilpin published <span class="titlem">Observations on the River Wye and several
        parts of South Wales, etc. relative chiefly to Picturesque Beauty; made in the summer of the
        year 1770</span>. This was illustrated with plates based on Gilpin's sketches, etched by
       his nephew William Sawrey Gilpin using the new aquatint process. Discussing the aesthetic
       qualities of the Wye valley, Gilpin initiated an aesthetic movement (the picturesque) that
       centred on Herefordshire, its chief proponents being two wealthy landowners of the Wye and
       Teme valleys, Uvedale Price and Richard Payne Knight. Bloomfield and his companions were
       familiar with Gilpin's book and occasionally discussed its principles (Bloomfield preferred
       Gray's response to the river). In sketching as they went, they continued a fashion for
       amateur sketching tours that Gilpin had helped popularise. </span>

      <span class="gloss"> a Marcher Lord, born into the Anglo-Welsh gentry, who was
       educated in London and served Richard II and later Henry Bolingbroke (who became Henry IV) in
       battle. In 1400 he rebelled against Henry with such success that in 1404 he was crowned
       Prince of Wales and, with the English largely driven out, announced his plan for an
       independent Wales with a parliament, universities and separate Welsh church. Though by 1412
       the military campaign of Prince Henry (later Henry V) brought that plan to ruin, forcing
       Owain's allies to surrender their castles, he himself was never captured, his later life and
       death remaining obscure. A romantic figure, owing in part to Shakespeare's portrayal of him
       in <span class="titlem">Henry IV</span> parts I and II, he remains a national hero in Wales.

       rights of the rural poor to glean the fields at harvest. He became, like the Duke of Grafton
       and many of Bloomfield's supporters among the gentry and aristocracy, a Unitarian. He was
       removed from the magistracy after having, in 1800, jumped into the tumbrel taking Sarah
       Lloyd, a servant girl, to the scaffold, and harangued the crowd about the injustice of the

       the property, to the regret of the local population, and returned to the West Indies where he
       became Governor of St. Vincent. There he spent extensively on the island's defences and, when

       expedition to Ireland in support of Diarmuid, King of Leinster, who had been driven out of
       his kingdom. The Earl crossed over in person in 1170, took both Waterford and Dublin, and was
       married to Diarmuid's daughter, Aoife, claiming the Kingship of Leinster after Diarmuid's
       death in 1171. Henry II, wary of his power, stripped Strongbow of his new holdings the same
       year, and invaded Ireland himself in 1171, putting his people in power. Strongbow returned to
       favour, and power in Ireland, in 1173 when he aided the King in his campaign against his
       rebelling sons. He died in 1176 after years of bitter struggle with Irish rebels. </span>

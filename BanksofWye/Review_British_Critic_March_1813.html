    <p class="pnonident"> [Review of] <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Banks of the Wye, a Poem in Four Books</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pnonident"> ART. III. The Banks of the Wye; a Poem. In four Books. By Robert Bloomfield, Author of the
     Farmer's Boy. 12mo. 134pp. 5s. Vernor and Co. &amp;c 1811 </p>
    <p class="pnonident"> THE poet of native inspiration, neither needing nor disdaining cultivation, may not unaptly
     be compared, himself, to the banks of the Wye, which abounding in natural beauties, are yet
     neither savage nor untractable. Of the Wye, however, we speak, as the bard did till lately, by
     fame alone, and not without a feeling that approaches to envy, respecting the delightful
     excursion of ten days, which his Muse has here immortalized. </p>
    <p class="indent1"> In his beautiful poem called 'Shooter's Hill,' (published in his 'Wild
     Flowers,') Bloomfield had spoken thus of the scenes of Wales. </p>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Of Cambrian mountains still I dream,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And mouldering vestiges of war;</div>
     <div class="indent3">By time-worn cliff, or classic stream</div>
     <div class="indent3">Would rove,â€”but prudence holds a bar.</div>
     <div class="indent3">Come then, O health, I'll strive to bound</div>
     <div class="indent3">My wishes to this airy stand,</div>
     <div class="indent3">'Tis not for me to trace around</div>
     <div class="indent3">The wonders of my native land.'</div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent1"> Some kind friends of the poet determined to offer him that pleasure, of which
     he there seemed to despair, and invited him to accompany them in a short excursion to South
     Wales. 'It was now,' says he, 'in the power of this happy party, to falsify such predictions,
     and to render a pleasure to the writer of no common kind.' The invitation was gladly accepted,
     and the plan realized in August, 1807. The present poem commemorates the thoughts and feelings
     of the author on this occasion; and though he does not undertake to give an elaborate account
     of the scenes which struck his delighted imagination, yet he offers what is much better, a
     lively image of a poet's mind, under circumstances of natural and innocent gratification. The
     following introduction tells, in a spirited and pleasing manner, the origin of the excursion. </p>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Rouse from thy slumber, pleasure calls, arise;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Quit thy half-rural bower, awhile despise</div>
     <div class="indent3">The thraldom that consumes thee. We who dwell</div>
     <div class="indent3">Far from thy land of smoke*, advise thee well,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Here Nature's bounteous hand around shall fling,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Scenes that thy Muse hath never dar'd to sing;</div>
     <div class="indent3">When sickness weigh'd thee down, and strength declin'd,</div>
     <div class="indent3">When dread eternity absorb'd thy mind,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Flow'd the predicting verse, by gloom o'erspread,</div>
     <div class="indent3">That 'Cambrian mountains' thou should'st never tread,</div>
     <div class="indent3">That 'time-worn cliff and classic stream to see'</div>
     <div class="indent3">Was wealth's prerogative, despair for thee.</div>
     <div class="indent3">Come to the proof; with us the breeze inhale,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Renounce despair, and come to Severn's vale;</div>
     <div class="indent3">And, where the COTSWOLD HILLS are stretch'd along,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Seek our green dell, as yet unknown to song:</div>
     <div class="indent3">Start hence with us, and trace, with raptur'd eye,</div>
     <div class="indent3">The wild meanderings of the beauteous Wye;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Thy ten days leisure ten days joys shall prove,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And rock and stream breathe amity and love.'</div>
    </div>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Such was the call; with instant ardour hailed,</div>
     <div class="indent3">The syren Pleasure caroll'd, and prevail'd;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Soon the deep dell appear'd, and the clear brow</div>
     <div class="indent3">Of ULEY BURY smil'd o'er all below,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Mansion, and flock, and circling woods that hung</div>
     <div class="indent3">Round the sweet pastures, where the sky-lark sung.</div>
     <div class="indent3">O for the fancy, vigorous and sublime,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Chaste as the theme, to triumph over time!</div>
     <div class="indent3">Bright as the rising day, and firm as truth,</div>
     <div class="indent3">To speak new transports to the low-born youth,</div>
     <div class="indent3">That bosoms still might throb, and still adore,</div>
     <div class="indent3">When his, who strives to charm them, beats no more.' P. 3.</div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent1"> These lines are all that the poem contains of this measure; the whole
     remainder is in the easy and cheerful eight syllable couplet, which Mr. W. Scott has lately
     raised to dignity and fashion. The beginning of the tour offers a lively picture. </p>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'The morrow came, and Beauty's eye</div>
     <div class="indent3">Ne'er beam'd upon a lovelier sky;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Imagination instant brought,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And dash'd amidst the train of thought,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Tints of the bow. The boatman stript;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Glee at the helm exulting tript,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And wav'd her flower-encircled wand,</div>
    </div>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Away, away, to Fairy Land.'</div>
     <div class="indent3">Light dipt the oars; but who can name</div>
     <div class="indent3">The various objects, dear to same,</div>
     <div class="indent3">That changing, doubting, wild, and strong,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Demand the noblest powers of song.' P. 10.</div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent1"> But the close of that book is more pleasing, because more distinct and clear. </p>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Low sunk the sun, his ev'ning beam</div>
     <div class="indent3">Scarce reach'd us on the tranquil stream;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Shut from the world, and all its din,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Nature's own bonds had clos'd us in;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Wood, and deep dell, and rock, and ridge,</div>
     <div class="indent3">From smiling Ross to MONMOUTH BRIDGE;</div>
     <div class="indent3">From morn, till twilight stole away,</div>
     <div class="indent3">A long, unclouded, glorious day.' P. 37.</div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent1"> This poem will probably, in future, be the companion of those who visit the
     Wye, for the sake of pleasurable excursion; who will delight to trace the varying scenes as
     here described, and particularly to discover the 'bluff rock,' which was named by the party
     after the poet. We will not say that, in every instance, he satisfies our ear with his measure,
     or our imagination with his pictures, but he has thrown an interest over the whole which will
     always enable the lover of poetry to attend him with pleasure. The opening of the fourth and
     last book is particularly pleasing. </p>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">''Tis sweet to hear the soothing chime,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And by thanksgiving measure time;</div>
     <div class="indent3">When hard-wrought poverty awhile</div>
     <div class="indent3">Upheaves the bending back to smile;</div>
     <div class="indent3">When servants hail, with boundless glee</div>
     <div class="indent3">The sweets of love and liberty;</div>
     <div class="indent3">For guiltless love will ne'er disown</div>
     <div class="indent3">The cheerful Sunday's market town,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Clean, silent, when his power's confess'd,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And trade's contention lull'd to rest.</div>
    </div>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">Seldom has worship cheer'd my soul</div>
     <div class="indent3">With such invincible controul!</div>
     <div class="indent3">It was a bright benignant hour,</div>
     <div class="indent3">The song of praise was full of power;</div>
     <div class="indent3">And, darting from the noon-day sky,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Amidst the tide of harmony,</div>
     <div class="indent3">O'er aile and pillar glancing strong,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Heav'n's radiant light inspir'd the song.</div>
     <div class="indent3">The word of peace, that can disarm</div>
     <div class="indent3">Care with his own peculiar charm,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Here flow'd a double stream, to cheer</div>
     <div class="indent3">The Saxon and the Mountaineer,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Of various stock, of various name,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Now join'd in rites, and join'd in fame.' P. 101.</div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent1"> In his conclusion, Bloomfield calls upon two classes of persons, more
     particularly, to visit the banks of the Wye. His invitation is animated and poetical. </p>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Ye who, ingulph'd in trade, endure</div>
     <div class="indent3">What gold alone can never cure,</div>
     <div class="indent3">The constant sigh for scenes of peace,</div>
     <div class="indent3">From the world's trammels free release: â€” </div>
     <div class="indent3">Wait not, for reason's sake attend,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Wait not in chains till times shall mend;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Till the clear voice, grown hoarse and gruff,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Cries, 'now I'll go, I'm rich enough.'</div>
     <div class="indent3">Youth, and the prime of manhood seize,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Steal ten days absence, ten days ease,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Bid ledgers from your mind depart,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Let mem'ry's treasures cheer the heart;</div>
     <div class="indent3">And when your children round you grow,</div>
     <div class="indent3">With opening charms, and manly brow,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Talk of the WYE, as some old dream,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Call it the wild, the wizard stream,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Sink in your broad arm-chair to rest,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And youth shall smile to see you blest.</div>
    </div>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'Artists, betimes your pow'rs employ,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And take the pilgrimage of joy;</div>
     <div class="indent3">The eye of genius may behold</div>
     <div class="indent3">A thousand beauties here untold;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Rock, that defies the winter's storm;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Wood, in its most imposing form,</div>
     <div class="indent3">That climbs the mountain, bows below,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Where deep th' unsullied waters flow.</div>
     <div class="indent3">Here Gilpin's eye transported scan'd</div>
     <div class="indent3">Views by no tricks of fancy plan'd;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Gray here, upon the stream reclin'd,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Stor'd with delight his ardent mind.</div>
     <div class="indent3">But let the vacant trifler stray</div>
     <div class="indent3">From thy enchantments far away;</div>
     <div class="indent3">For should, from Fashion's rainbow train,</div>
     <div class="indent3">The idle and the vicious, vain,</div>
     <div class="indent3">In sacrilege presume to move</div>
     <div class="indent3">Through these dear scenes of peace and love,</div>
     <div class="indent3">The Spirit of the Stream would rise,</div>
     <div class="indent3">In wrathful mood, and tenfold size,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And nobly guard his COLDWELL spring,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And bid his inmost caverns ring,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Loud thund'ring on the giddy crew,</div>
    </div>
    <div xmlns="" class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">'My stream was never meant for you.'</div>
     <div class="indent3">But ye, to nobler feelings born,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Who sense and nature dare not scorn,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Glide gaily on, and ye shall find</div>
     <div class="indent3">The blest serenity of mind,</div>
     <div class="indent3">That springs from silence; or shall raise</div>
     <div class="indent3">The hand, the eye, the voice of praise.</div>
     <div class="indent3">Live then sweet stream! and henceforth be</div>
     <div class="indent3">The darling of posterity;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Lov'd for thyself, for ever dear,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Like beauty's smile, and virtue's tear,</div>
     <div class="indent3">Till time his striding race give o'er,</div>
     <div class="indent3">And verse itself shall charm no more.'</div>
    </div>
    <p class="indent1"> Readers! you have now before you an ample specimen of Bloomfield's 'Banks of
     the Wye.' You will not probably rank this poem with the happiest of his efforts, nor will you
     think it unworthy of him. It might have been more perfect, but still it has many charms. </p>

                            the site. Guns Mill was used primarily for armament production until

                            founded in c 1150 which, after the dissolution of the monasteries, was
                            granted to Sir William Kingston. By 1692 it was in the possession of
                            Catharina Boevey (died 1727). After her death it passed to the

                            the Clywd-Powys Archaeological Trust: 'Brecon Gaer, also known as Y
                            Gaer, is situated . . . near Aberyscir just north of the river Usk. The
                            earliest fort was built about AD 75 with defensive banks of clay which
                            rested upon a cobbled surface. A wooden palisade would have protected
                            the defenders. The buildings inside, one of which may have been
                            stabling, were also constructed in wood. At this time the troops at Y
                            Gaer included Vettonian cavalry from Spain. The tombstone of a young
                            cavalryman, Candidus, has been found a mile north of the fort and is now
                            in the Brecknock Museum, Brecon.' </span>

    <p><span id="d22e486"><!--anchor1--></span>This edition presents a rare surviving example of the kind of multimedia production that
     arose from one of the new cultural activities that characterised the late eighteenth century
     and gave rise to Romanticism—the picturesque and antiquarian tour. It comprises a facsimile of
     the manuscript sketch- and scrap-book that Robert Bloomfield made after his 1807 tour of the
     Wye, an annotated transcription of the prose tour-journal that he incorporated into his scrap
     book, and a collated and annotated text of the poetic versions of the tour that were published
     (as <em>The Banks of Wye</em>) in 1811, 1813, and 1823. Also included are reproductions of
     the engravings that illustrated the 1811 and 1813 publications, deleted or unadopted passages
     from the <a href="BanksOfWyeManuscripts.html">manuscript of the poem</a>, and a selection of
     <a href="materials.html">reviews from journals of the time</a>. The whole represents a visually and
     verbally rich response to the fashionable tour of the Wye that the poets <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrayThomas" title="Thomas Gray">Thomas Gray</a> and William Wordsworth, the artists <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SandbyPaul" title="Paul Sandby">Paul Sandby</a> and J.

	 <p class="indent1">Entering the valley later
     than these tourists, Bloomfield took an already well-travelled and much-described route. His
     Wye texts reveal the cultural significance the tour had already acquired but also show the way
     that tourism redefined existing genres. It put the topographical and Georgic poem in motion:
     views were now observed from a boat or carriage rather than from hilltops. It encouraged
     appreciation of native, rather than Italian, scenes and antiquities, identifying the tourist
     patriotically with British, rather than classical, landscape and history. And it promoted a
     tradition of amateur enquiry: Bloomfield's manuscript sketch- and scrap-book is an example of
     the newly popular fashion for on-the-spot sketching. Full of self-penned images of views and
     ruins, it is a fine example of the visual culture that the English gentry began to produce and
     to value, a homemade book to pass around in drawing rooms before turning either to the latest
     set of engravings published by Mr Westall or Mr Turner or to the poetic tour —<em>The Banks
      of Wye</em> — that Bloomfield himself issued in print. Bloomfield, indeed, hoped to issue
     not just the poetic tour but also the 'whole triple-page'd Journal, Drawings, prose, and
      rhime'.<span id="Note1_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note1"><sup>1</sup></a> Cost prohibited such a publication at the
     time: only now, with this composite edition of poem, prose, scrap- and sketch-book, can we, the
     public, see the multimedia response to the Wye that was then accessible only to the intimate
     friends among whom the manuscript circulated.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e517"><!--anchor1--></span>If this edition reveals much about the picturesque tour and the visual and
     manuscript culture of the Romantic era, it also tells us much about Bloomfield himself.
     Although hardly a household name or canonical author now, he was, when he took his tour of the
     Wye valley and the Welsh borders in 1807, already established as the best-selling 'pastoral
     poet' of the age—far better known than Wordsworth and Coleridge, whose <em>Lyrical
      Ballads</em> his own <em>Farmer's Boy</em> (1800) outsold by twenty to one. Indeed, in
     the eyes of contemporaries, it was Bloomfield, rather than the two West Country and Lakeland
     poets we now call 'Romantics', who had revived both landscape verse (the dominant poetic genre
     in the 1700s) and Rural Tales (the title of his second, 1802, collection) for the new century.
     But he had not done so by harvesting the already-poetic landscape of the Wye valley. For
     although Bloomfield admired the work of John Dyer, who had imagined the Welsh Marches as
     Siluria—a culturally unique zone in which, since Roman times, British history had been rooted
     into the landscape<span id="Note2_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note2"><sup>2</sup></a> — it was nevertheless, the flatter area of Suffolk that inspired his poetry.
     Suffolk because it was there, in a small village, that Bloomfield had spent his boyhood and
     there, in that same small village, that his family still lived. Bloomfield himself, however,
     did not: his rural poetry detailed his Suffolk youth from a distance; it was a new kind of
     Georgic not just because it spoke of rural work from the perspective of a labourer rather than
     a landowner but also because it spoke from the city. Bloomfield's were poems for the new
     urbanising Britain because they remembered the country from the position of a villager who had,
     as so many thousands did in the early nineteenth century, emigrated to London. And they did so
     from a world of sweated labour: Bloomfield's boyhood was an emotion recollected not in
     tranquillity but in the workshop; he composed verse in his head whilst labouring for hours a
     day as a shoemaker in an East End garret.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e535"><!--anchor1--></span>If Bloomfield's poetry gives the lie to Wordsworth's fear (expressed in the
     Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>) that mechanical labour corrupts, by its very
     repetitiveness, the taste of the labourer, it nevertheless displays many of the same
     characteristics as Wordsworth's own verse—a matter not of mutual influence but of similar
     responses to times in which an industrialising culture left many people deracinated and
     yearning for a half-remembered place of origin—a childhood land in which the power of capital
     had not yet disturbed the culture or the consciousness. These similar responses included the
     organisation of verse according to the work-rhythms of shepherds and labourers, the penning of
     rural tales based on popular ballads and songs, and the addressing of poems to favourite
     landscapes. Not surprisingly, Bloomfield was an early supporter of Wordsworth's poetry: he had
     read 'Tintern Abbey' by 1802; he was by 1807 a poet steeped in the latest developments in the
     loco-descriptive poetry that James Thomson and William Cowper had perfected a few generations
     earlier.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e541"><!--anchor1--></span>Bloomfield took to the hills. When he climbed Box Hill, Surrey, in 1803,
     during a solitary walking tour, it was the first time he had been in upland country, having
     previously, like most of the labouring classes, been confined to the fields and the shop where
     he worked: </p>
    <blockquote class="quote"><p> Having been harrassd by too much thinking and too many trivial engagements, and an
     employment that I shall never like, I determined that I would respire one mouthfull of real
     country air if possible and I know at the same time that pollution of smoke reaches ten miles
     round the Metropolis. I had heard much of Leithe Hills and of Box Hill in the neighbourhood of
     Dorking. . . . Remember that I am no Welshman, therefore to me these Hills are Cader Idris's
     and Snowdens.— (<a href="../letterEEd.25.106.html">letter 106</a> of <em>The Letters of Robert Bloomfield</em>: to
     George Bloomfield, 17 April 1803)</p></blockquote>
    <p><span id="d22e551"><!--anchor1--></span>The tour put Bloomfield in the position of a Romantic for the first time: a solitary walker
     travelling as a social, aesthetic and moral antidote to the effects of modern, urban life upon
     him. It led to no published writing, only to private correspondence, but it made him all the
     more eager to go west in 1807 when a tour of Wales was suggested by his friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary Lloyd Baker">Mary Lloyd Baker</a> of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley" title="Uley">Uley</a> in Gloucestershire.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e560"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Lloyd Baker">Lloyd Baker</a>, née Sharp, had
     written a fan-letter to Bloomfield in 1803. This led to a correspondence and to Bloomfield's
     warm reception in Lloyd Baker's extended family-circle of sisters, aunts and uncles, based near
     London and in Northamptonshire. The Sharps were radical Whig gentry (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpGranville" title="Granville Sharp">Granville Sharp</a>, the anti-slavery and anti-cruelty
     campaigner, was Lloyd Baker's uncle) who neither wished to interfere in his publications nor
     make him recite verses in public. They had no designs upon him, though he remained conscious of
     their difference in class, power and education and knew that he could never reciprocate their
     invitations to their houses. But Bloomfield enjoyed their attention and readily made his way in
     August 1807 to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley" title="Uley">Uley</a>, to take the tour in the company of
      <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Lloyd Baker">Lloyd Baker</a>, her husband the local landowner,
     and their friends <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert" title="Robert Bransby Cooper">Robert Bransby Cooper</a> and his
     son and daughter (relatives of the radical surgeon Astley Cooper). Together, the party then
     embarked on an elongated version of the already-popular tourist route: they went by road from
      <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley" title="Uley">Uley</a> to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RossOnWye" title="Ross">Ross</a>,
     then by boat along the Wye, alighting at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#TinternAbbey" title="Tintern">Tintern</a>.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e587"><!--anchor1--></span>This route was already established, featuring in the prose of picturesque
     tours, and in numerous watercolours and engravings. Of the former, Bloomfield became familiar
     with work of the poet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrayThomas" title="Thomas Gray">Thomas Gray</a>, who toured the
     Wye and Wales in summer 1770, and whose enthusiastic notes about the scenery and antiquities
     were published after his death as <em>A Catalogue of the Antiquities, Houses, Parks,
      Plantations, Scenes, and Situations, in England and Wales</em> (1773). He also refers to the
     aesthetic discussions of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GilpinWilliam" title="William Gilpin">William Gilpin</a> as
     revealed in the seminal work of the picturesque, <em>Observations on the River Wye and
      several parts of South Wales, etc. relative chiefly to Picturesque Beauty; made in the summer
      of the year 1770</em> (1782). Gilpin's book was illustrated with plates based on Gilpin's
     sketches, etched by his nephew William Sawrey Gilpin using the aquatint process. Sketching as
     they went, Bloomfield and his companions continued a fashion for sketching tours that Gilpin
     had helped popularise. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BanksJoseph" title="Sir Joseph Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> had come
     down the river in 1771, bringing the artist <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SandbyPaul" title="Paul Sandby">Paul
      Sandby</a> with him, and aquatints after Sandby's pictures circulated widely. In 1794 Sir
     George Beaumont, a keen amateur artist, later to be Wordsworth's friend and patron, went to
     Tintern with the painter Thomas Hearne. Hearne's pictures were engraved and published in his
      <em>Antiquities of Great-Britain, Illustrated in Views of Monasteries, Castles, and
      Churches...</em> (1786-1807). Other artists followed, recognising a growing market for
     topographical and historical views: by the time Bloomfield embarked, sites on the Wye such as
      <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GoodrichCastle" title="Goodrich Castle">Goodrich Castle</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#TinternAbbey" title="TinternAbbey">Tintern Abbey</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Chepstow" title="Chepstow Castle">Chepstow Castle</a> had been drawn, engraved and published many times over.<span id="Note3_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note3"><sup>3</sup></a> To service the growing numbers of tourists, a local trade grew up:
     the Monmouth printer <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeathCharles" title="Charles Heath">Charles Heath</a> began to
     specialise in guidebooks. In rapid succession he published <em>A Descriptive Account of
      Raglan Castle</em> (1792), a <em>Descriptive Account of Tintern Abbey</em> (1793), an
      <em>Account of the Scenery of the Wye</em> (1795), <em>The Excursion down the Wye</em>
     (1796), and <em>Accounts of … Monmouth</em> (1804). Bloomfield used the <em>Excursion
      down the Wye</em> in preparing his own Wye texts and also relied upon the recently-published
     work of the antiquarian and traveller <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CoxeWilliam" title="William Coxe">William Coxe</a>,
      <em>A Historical Tour in Monmouthshire</em> (1801). </p>

    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e656"><!--anchor1--></span>It was not only in print that the Wye tourist received assistance. An
     infrastructure grew up to service travellers' needs, as Suzanne Matheson describes:</p>
    <blockquote class="quote"><p> A water journey to Tintern Abbey was less taxing for passengers than land-travel,
     although not free entirely from danger or discomfort. Recreational excursions on the Wye were
     taking place by the 1740s, instituted by the hospitable Rev. Dr. John Egerton of Ross (later
     Bishop of Durham), the so-called 'father of the Wye voyage'. In 1745 Egerton 'caused a pleasure
     boat to be built to enable his guests to enjoy excursions by water amid scenery which could not
     fail to delight and surprise.'<span id="Note4_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note4"><sup>4</sup></a> The
     rental and provisioning of manned boats effectively became one of the earliest organized
     tourist industries in the area. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GilpinWilliam" title="William Gilpin">William Gilpin</a>
     travelled in this manner during the fortnight-long 1770 tour that resulted in his influential
      <em>Observations on the River Wye</em>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrayThomas" title="Thomas Gray">Thomas
      Gray</a> ranked his descent of the Wye from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RossOnWye" title="Ross">Ross</a>
     to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Chepstow" title="Chepstow">Chepstow</a> as the 'very principal light, and capital
     feature of my journey.'<span id="Note5_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note5"><sup>5</sup></a> By the end of the century, tourist directories advise that these boats,
     'lightly constructed, which are used with or without sail, and navigated by three men' were
     kept in 'constant readiness' for tourists at Ross-on-Wye.<span id="Note6_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1796 the charge for a trip from Ross-on-Wye down to
     Chepstow at the mouth of the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Severn" title="Severn">Severn</a> was three guineas,
     plus provisioning for the boatmen; from Ross to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Monmouth" title="Monmouth">Monmouth</a> the fee was one and a half guineas. . . . Until the end of the eighteenth
     century the boats appear to have been quite simple — 'small, but filled up with no less
     convenience than neatness', or 'a good covered boat, well stored with provisions' are typical
      descriptions.<span id="Note7_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note7"><sup>7</sup></a> By the late 1830s, however, the vessels had become like 'a small
     floating parlour', made commodious with sunshades, cushioned seats, and a table. At Ross 'the
     Wye is a good little river, without vices or virtues', as one traveler described.<span id="Note8_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note8"><sup>8</sup></a> After engaging a boat, tourists
     would descend past <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GoodrichCastle" title="Goodrich Castle">Goodrich Castle</a> situated on
     the English or Herefordshire side. Later, in the gorge near <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ColdwellRocks" title="Coldwell Rocks">Coldwell Rocks</a>, it was common to halt for a climb to
     take in the view from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#SymondsYat" title="Symonds Yat">Symonds Yat</a>, while the rowers
     brought the boat the long way round. Afterwards, the current moving more quickly now, travelers
     would pass <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RaglanCastle" title="Raglan Castle">Raglan Castle</a>, destroyed in the Civil War,
     and land at the substantial market town of Monmouth. . . . Roughly ten miles further down-river
     from Monmouth is <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#TinternAbbey" title="Tintern">Tintern</a>, where the Wye is tidal and
     its character more capricious. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeathCharles" title="Charles Heath">Charles Heath</a> warns
     in his guide that 'the Boat being obliged to descend with the Tide to Chepstow, <em>two

      Abbey'.<span id="Note9_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note9"><sup>9</sup></a> . . . Between Tintern and Chepstow the
     river widens and quickens again in its run towards the Severn. The rich farmland of the Lancaut
     peninsula, with its little dreaming ruined chapel, contrasts the precipitous rocks and hanging
     forests at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Windcliff" title="Wyndcliff">Wyndcliff</a>. The Upper and Lower Wyndcliff

    <p><span id="d22e759"><!--anchor1--></span>Bloomfield's party followed in the wake of earlier travellers, but also added to the Wye
     itinerary a further land trip out of the Wye valley into mountainous Wales: <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Abergavenny" title="Abergavenny">Abergavenny</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Crickhowell" title="Crickhowell">Crickhowell</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brecon" title="Brecon">Brecon</a>, before returning to the

      <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cheltenham" title="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a> and home. </p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e784"><!--anchor1--></span>But it was the boat trip along the river that initially fascinated Bloomfield
     and that led him into the spots celebrated by picturesque writers, not least Tintern Abbey.
     Bloomfield's response to the famous ruin was a little different from Gilpin's and Wordsworth's:
     he neither wished for a mallet to break some of the gables to make the abbey more picturesque
     nor averted his gaze from the beggars and ironworks that clustered around. Instead, moved too
     deeply to sit and sketch the arches as his companions did, he '<a href="MSJournal.html#gavevent">gave vent to my feelings by
     singing for their amusement and my own the 104th Psalm</a>'. The 104th Psalm thanks the Lord for creating the earth. In the King James'
     version Bloomfield knew, it evokes pastoral valleys such as that in which Tintern stands:</p>
    <div class="lg">
     <div class="indent1">He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills. </div>
     <div class="indent1">They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their
      thirst. </div>
     <div class="indent1">By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among
      the branches.</div>
     <div class="indent1">He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the
      fruit of thy works. </div>
     <div class="indent1">He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man:
      that he may bring forth food out of the earth.</div>
     <div class="indent8">(Psalm 104:10-14)</div>
    </div>
    <p><span id="d22e809"><!--anchor1--></span>Bloomfield declared of his performance 'though no "fretted vault" remains to harmonize the
     sound, it soothed me into that state of mind which is most to be desired'. 'Fretted vault' is a
     quotation from Gray's 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard': 'Where thro' the long-drawn
     aisle and fretted vault / The pealing anthem swells the note of praise' (lines 39-40). For
     Bloomfield, then, the pastoral valley and ruined church call forth a poetic act of worship,
     poetry being the mode which he feels to be profound enough to express his love of nature and
     its creator. This act, he knows, is over-determined: he sees the abbey and imagines his
     Psalm-singing in relation to Gray's portrait of the country church as a place where the act of
     commemoration acquires value. He is self-consciously following in Gray's verse-steps, quietly
     claiming poetry as a deeper, more pious, response to Tintern than the picturesque sketches that
     tourists were expected to make.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e812"><!--anchor1--></span>Visiting the Wye as a labourer-poet taken-up by well-meaning patrons, and as a
     tourist expected to sing for his tour, Bloomfield found himself in a new and precarious
     position. Mostly, he enjoyed it, since, precisely because he had been tied to his trade in a
     way gentlemen poets never were (even poor and radical ones like Wordsworth and Coleridge), he
     had never before travelled west of London. Nonetheless, his new and, to him, anomalous
     position, a visitor rather than rather a Londoner recollecting his native Suffolk, led him to
     commence an innovative kind of work—a conventional tour poem (<em>The Banks of Wye</em>
     (1811)) that was to accompany a prose guide with accompanying sketches made at picturesque
     spots. As such, the project, like Wordsworth's <em>Description of the Scenery of the
      Lakes</em> (1811) was a new, hybrid, genre, the tour guidebook as rewritten by the poet to
     feature his own verse and illustrations. The effect was to represent the region as a place of
     aesthetic value and antiquarian interest: footnotes gave historical information about ruined
     castles and Roman forts. Bloomfield hoped to take advantage of his popularity as a
     topographical poet and of the Wye's renown as a picturesque location, building on the success
     of <em>The Farmer's Boy</em>, which featured many engravings of rural scenes, by feeding
     the public's ever-increasing desire for lavishly illustrated books.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e824"><!--anchor1--></span>Bloomfield began the making of his Wye-book while still basking in the warmth
     of the new experience and the attention paid him by the gentlewomen of the party. His letters
     show him taking his new roles as artist and tour guide very seriously, seeking sketches and
     verse from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary Lloyd Baker">Mary Lloyd Baker</a> and promising her a
     private view of his work:</p>

    <p><span id="d22e864"><!--anchor1--></span>Mildly flirtatious letters of this kind were Bloomfield's way of prolonging a relationship
     that was valuable to him: <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Lloyd Baker's">Lloyd Baker's</a>
     admiration, and that of her sisters and aunt, gave him confidence without intimidating him (as
     the patronage of noblemen tended to do). He flourished in a feminine circle, enjoying being
     humorous for their benefit, unbuttoning as he could not to others outside his class, but
     knowing, all the same, that his value to these gentlewomen depended upon his amusing them. He
     was, nonetheless, careful to show the ladies' powerful husbands that he needed their help too,
     consulting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Thomas Lloyd Baker">Thomas Lloyd Baker</a> and his friend

     <em>An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire</em>, adding to both prose journal and verse tour
     historical notes that affiliated his work to the antiquarian texts consulted by learned
     gentlemen.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e882"><!--anchor1--></span> Despite Bloomfield's diligent effort, his Wye-book never appeared in the
     intended tripartite prose/poetry/picture format. Back in London, away from the Lloyd
     Baker/Sharp circle, afflicted by financial difficulties and sinking into depression, he found
     work slowing-up. It was not until February 1811, after many months' practice at turning his
     rough sketches into finished drawings and much research into local history, that he sent the
     Wye-book to his publishers, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VernorThomas" title="Vernor">Vernor</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Hood">Hood</a>, only to hear that that they were now 'averse to
     the costly and fashionable stile of publishing' and would produce only a smaller-scale volume
     with no more than four illustrations (<a href="../letterEEd.25.256.html">letter 256</a> of <em>The Letters of
      Robert Bloomfield</em>: to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary Lloyd Baker">Mary Lloyd Baker</a>,
     16 January-2 February 1811). Their decision may have been an early indication of the financial
     difficulties that would bankrupt the firm after <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Hood's">Hood's</a> death in 1811. At all events, it made the book they did publish in that year a
     far less appealing production, containing only Bloomfield's Georgic verse and a few engravings
     after his fellow-tourist <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert" title="Bransby Cooper's">Bransby Cooper's</a>
     sketches. Nevertheless, <em>The Banks of Wye</em>, now more straightforwardly a poetry
     publication, was a substantial work, albeit not one for which the public was looking from a
     poet they liked for his tales of village life. Two centuries later, however, we can finally
     reconstitute the Wye-book that Bloomfield originally prepared, by accompanying the 1811 poem
     with the prose journal (transcribed from the manuscript), exhibiting the sketch- and
     scrap-book, restoring deleted passages of the poem from manuscript, and investigating hitherto
     unpublished letters.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e908"><!--anchor1--></span>Reconstituted here, Bloomfield's Wye-book can be seen to have made a
     distinctive response to the tour that was, at the same time, a departure in his own
     oeuvre—despite its affiliation to the conventional genre of the tourist poem and guidebook. In
     part this was, as Tim Burke has noted,<span id="Note11_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note11"><sup>11</sup></a> a matter of Bloomfield's sympathetic understanding of the work of the rural
     labourers that he now witnessed, in passing, as a leisured tourist—an understanding that
     subverts the unthinking aestheticisation of labour that often characterises the picturesque.
     The informal prose journal shows Bloomfield chatting long with a shoemaker friend in Ross;
     discussing the price of cider with their Welsh guide; noting that the Welsh girl who served
     their meal at Tintern was glad to see them go. Everywhere, he is immediately interested in the
     people who work the landscape, regarding them as authorities on it as important as the guide
     books, aesthetic treatises and county histories. His viewpoint comprehends not just the viewing
     stations built by local landowners such as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MorrisValentine" title="Valentine Morris">Valentine
      Morris</a> but also the cracks of the floorboards in his inn-chamber, through which he peeps
     at the ostlers and maids breakfasting together below. It also sees the burgeoning and smoky
     forges, smelters and mills that made the sylvan Wye an important industrial centre. And there
     is a passage of social and moral criticism of the Prince of Wales, which Bloomfield's literary
     executor Joseph Weston excised from the version of the journal he published in <em>The
      Remains of Robert Bloomfield</em> (1824):</p>
    <blockquote class="quote"><p>The prince was at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cheltenham" title="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>, and though the
     votaries of fashion follow him as gnats do a horse, to sting him, or to be lashd to death, I
     found all moralists, and all thinkers, through the whole <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">xxxxx</span> &lt;town&gt; speak of him with a shake of the head, and a humbled, and negative
     kind of exultation—I hope the feeling will last as long as <em>truth</em> and
      <em>history</em>.</p></blockquote>
    <p><span id="d22e941"><!--anchor1--></span>Although Bloomfield was not a political writer, there are acerbic comments about the excess
     and hypocrisy of the wealthy in his letters and he maintained radical and reformist sympathies.
     These, however, are not apparent in Weston's timorous and conventional version of the journal,
     which was posthumously produced and had no authorial sanction (it appeared with spelling and
     punctuation regularised and with occasional slang and accompanying sketches and maps removed).
     Accordingly, it is not represented in this edition of Bloomfield's Wye texts.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e944"><!--anchor1--></span> The journal, as the facsimiles presented here show, was never simply a verbal
     document. Bloomfield carefully interspersed his prose description with a wealth of visual
     material, surrounding it on the page and facing it too, so that writing is but one element of a
     representation of the tour to which pictures and maps were also fundamental. In this respect
     Bloomfield's Wye-book offers a glimpse of the practice, common especially among gentlewomen, of
     compiling sketch- and scrap-books that included verse, drawings and letters, reconstituting a
     place, an experience or a relationship on paper. It is not, that is to say, the sketchbook of a
     professional artist who intended to work his on-the-spot sketches into finished oils at a later
     date. Rather, it is a record of the tour produced with an audience in mind – compiled to be
     shared after the event with his fellow tourists, to aid them in recreating the tour, and the
     companionship the tour offered, in memory. Even the sketches are social: Bloomfield includes
     his own designs, in and around his prose, with his copies of original drawings made by Robert
     Bransby Cooper and Mary Lloyd Baker and loaned to him after the party's return. They represent
     his incorporation in a gentleman- (and woman-)ly tradition of amateur art: Cooper and Lloyd
     Baker had received tuition in drawing—mastering perspective, composition and shading—and
     Bloomfield's sketches showed them that he in turn had learned from them. </p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e947"><!--anchor1--></span> By including maps in his Wye-book, Bloomfield showed he was keen to anchor
     the sketches and the prose to places on a route. Like the published guidebooks, which began to
     feature maps from the 1790s, he sought to locate the views in a graduated space that, by virtue
     of its cartographic representation, he and others could reaccess virtually (moreover, he
     included in the prose journal specific timings of arrival and departure from each place
     visited: the tour would be relivable in memory because it was calibrated spatially and
     temporally on paper). He pasted in small-scale engraved county maps of Gloucestershire and
     Monmouthshire, but these offered little local detail. And so he made his own map, a fold-out
     sheet he entitled 'Sketch of the River Wye, from Ross to Chepstow'. Delineating the river in a
     strip-map, this marked the principal stopping point and views: it was, in effect, a new kind of
     sketch map aimed at serving the tourist rather than at giving an overall survey of an estate or
     county (it would have been of no use to a land surveyor, a landowner or an army). As such it
     reflected a change in mapping conventions produced by a change in the social use (and users) of
     maps: in that other area of tourism, the Lake District, Peter Crosthwaite began in 1783 to sell
     linear maps of the main lakes to tourists who wanted to follow the shorelines in search of
     picturesque views. The lake, like Bloomfield's river, was abstracted from the country that
     surrounded it, its banks becoming the object of largescale (three inches to the mile)
     cartographic focus. And the map now had for the first time an openly aesthetic, rather than
     economic, aim — to record beauty spots rather than landholdings or political boundaries.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e950"><!--anchor1--></span> Bloomfield's map remained in manuscript, part of the tripartite Wye-book that
     never achieved publication. What he did publish. however, the verse Banks of Wye, defines more
     directly and forcefully than ever before the new purpose of touring: not the education of taste
     in rules of aesthetic judgement (as in Gilpin) but the mental restorative that holiday-escape
     into natural beauty offered an urban middle-class otherwise chained to the account-book and the
     office. </p>

    </div>
    <p><span id="d22e1007"><!--anchor1--></span>Here the Wye is a consolation of age: taking a longer view than Wordsworth at Tintern,
     Bloomfield sees the river, recreated virtually in memory and talk, as reviving, in an otherwise
     sedentary figure, a younger and livelier self. It confers a blessed experience of wildness that
     is also a token of masculinity: the father, defined by domesticity, is cheered in himself and
     admired by his children because recollecting his experiences of 'the wizard stream' conjures
     into being the 'manly brow' of his 'prime of manhood'. </p>

    </div>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1010"><!--anchor1--></span> Bloomfield is ambivalent about the picturesque. His Wye-book was to feature
     engravings after his and his friends' sketches. His prose journal records them sketching at
     every castle they visited. At Tintern, however, sketching was not a deep enough response and,
     as he concludes his verse tour, he offers only faint praise of Gilpin. Artists may learn from
     the Wye, he declares, but by encountering nature's forms and rhythms rather than by applying
     artificial criteria and apparatus:</p>
    <div class="lg">

     <div class="indent3">Stored with delight his ardent mind. </div>
     <div class="indent3">(<em>The Banks of Wye</em>, <a href="BanksOfWyeIV.html#artistsbetimes">book IV, lines 421-32</a>)</div>
    </div>
    <p><span id="d22e1065"><!--anchor1--></span>Gilpin is 'transported' when he looks at nature unguided by fancy or predetermined ideas.
     Bloomfield's role model is, instead, the poet Gray, who absorbs delight by letting his ardent
     mind repose on the water, as if in meditation.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1068"><!--anchor1--></span> How to recline upon the stream was a question for Bloomfield's own
     representation of the tour. His poetic endorsement of natural form led to a problem that was
     not resolved in the published <em>Banks of Wye</em>, a problem to which the tripartite
     Wye-book would have presented a novel solution. The problem concerns his own medium: whether
     nature's forms and rhythms are always so neatly harnessable within the polite diction and
     conventional rhyming couplets of the tour poem. Had the poem been combined with the colloquial
     first-person prose journal and the amateur sketches as it is here, then its obtrusion of
     formality upon the reader would have been seen to be only one version of the journey, in
     dialogue with more informal responses which, without it, might themselves have seemed too
     slight and private for publication. Standing alone, the published poem seemed too mixed,
     veering from the colloquial to the stilted, lacking the animation of <em>The Farmer's
      Boy</em> because Bloomfield did not speak for the Wye landscape as his own—known as a place
     marked on his body and mind by work in its fields. The original verse-manuscript, deleted
     passages from which are presented in this edition, shows that Bloomfield recognised this
     difficulty and found an original way to overcome it, for it begins more in a comic-heroic than
     a polite manner with a prelude about a giant called Scoop, who had fashioned the hills and
     dales of the Gloucestershire country in which the Lloyd Bakers lived:</p>
    <div class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">When Time's young curls embower'd his brow</div>
     <div class="indent3">And infant streams began to flow,</div>

     <div class="indent3">And all the Island at command,</div>

     <div class="indent3">Fancy still hears his foot rebound,</div>
     <div class="indent3">When <em>Stinchcombe</em> trembled at the sound.</div>
     <div class="indent3">Here Cambrian mountains caught his eye</div>
     <div class="indent3">Towring to meet the distant sky</div>

    </div>
    <p><span id="d22e1222"><!--anchor1--></span>With their deliberately clunky rhymes ('truly/Uley'), slangy diction ('wizzed' 'zigzagg'd')
     and undignified account of the country's origin as a giant's casual whim of imitating the hill
     country of Wales, these opening lines undercut their own pretensions to the heroic. They also
     present a compliment to Bloomfield's gentlemanly (and womanly) patrons, in which deference is
     pre-empted by humour. That humour is derived from local folklore: Scoop was a Gloucestershire
     descendant of the giant of Shropshire legend, Gwendol Wrekin ap Shenkin ap Mynyddmawr, who
     intended to flood the town of Shrewsbury by dumping a shovelful of earth into the river Severn.
     He was discouraged by a local shoemaker who told him 'It's a very long way to Shrewsbury . . .
     look at all these shoes I've worn out walking back from there!' The giant then dropped the
     spadeful of earth on the ground next to him, where it became the Wrekin hill.<span id="Note12_return"><!--anchor1--></span><a class="notelink" title="Go to note" href="#Note12"><sup>12</sup></a> It was     probably the comic heroism of a fellow shoemaker, and the humorous opposition of Wales and
     England, that made the story appeal to Bloomfield: he mentioned the giants sleeping in the
     Welsh mountains later in the poem. It was typical of him to assert and mock his own role as
     poet creator, and also typical of him to draw on local lore as well as learned books.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1231"><!--anchor1--></span>As a beginning to a four-book landscape poem, the lines on Giant Scoop are
     highly unorthodox, a versification of the tongue-in-cheek humour of Bloomfield's correspondence
     with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Lloyd Baker">Lloyd Baker</a>. They are playful, revealing
     the poet's enjoyment of his own ability to fictionalise, to tell it like it's not—and in this
     they reflect the West Country's status as a charming holiday place, an escape from Bloomfield's
     London cares and from his branding as a Suffolk labourer poet. Yet for all that, they do
     concern themselves with labour, as Bloomfield so often did: funny though they are, they show
     the giant working up a sweat digging. Polished, knowing and displaying a flexible deployment of
     Samuel Butler's Hudibrastic cocktail of octosyllabic couplets, phrasal verbs and casual
     diction, Bloomfield's light verses still suggest, however jokily, that the country depends on
     backbreaking toil—a point quietly made later in the poem when the tourists in their
     pleasure-boat glide effortlessly past bent-backed gleaners in the fields. Bloomfield's West
     Country was not a holiday-land for everyone.</p>

    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1237"><!--anchor1--></span> As different from Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey' as they are from Gilpin's
      <em>Observations</em>, Bloomfield's lines on Scoop reveal a cultivated, accomplished,
     well-read poet entertaining his patrons; they also suggest that he was worldly enough to know
     that the Cotswolds were not, after all, the Alps and that, therefore, describing them in pious
     and solemn terms would only lead to bathos. Nevertheless, getting the tone right was a vexing
     matter for him, and as the tour became a more and more distant memory, and the flirtatious
     feminine circle receded from his grasp, he worried about whether the opening was appropriate
     for a piece intended for public consumption. Revealingly, it was when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary Lloyd Baker">Mary Lloyd Baker</a> wrote to him during the course of
     another West Country tour she was making (of Cheddar Gorge) that, in the light of her intimate

    <p><span id="d22e1262"><!--anchor1--></span>In the end, <em>The Banks of Wye</em>, to its detriment, appeared without Scoop: the
     lines fell prey to Bloomfield's anxiety (evident in the more sober main body of the poem) about
     his qualifications to write in the style of a leisured gentleman—a position in which the trip
     put him for the first time. He internalised the perceived doubts of his patrons, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Capel Lofft">Capel Lofft</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Thomas Park">Thomas Park</a>, literary gentlemen who edited poetry for magazines, and consulted other      friends too: it seems none of these men, arbiters of conventional taste, saw the opening as
     serious enough. Effectively, as another letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary">Mary</a> reveals, Bloomfield's was too playful a discourse to meet male expectations about
     the proper language for topographical poetry:</p>
    <blockquote class="quote"><p> Since you saw or heard any part of my Journal, and I think I remember <em>how
      far</em> I had then proceeded in my amusement, much alteration has taken place in the plan
     and divisions &amp;c. As I advanced I began to conceive that it might even eventualy be renderd
     fit for publication, and this perswasion set me about a thorough examination and revision. I
     concieved that it was, owing to the careless and hasty manner of its early composition, much
     too hudibrastic, and containd a vast deal of useless matter which might give way to the
     superior graces of nature, or to unbridled fancy. I had finished it, as I thought, according to
     this plan, last summer; and I had the joint opinion of my then companions, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Inskip">Inskip</a>, himself a poet, and a man of strong mind, and
     my host, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a> of Shefford, Beds, and as he
     has read and thought more than any man I ever found in his station of life, and his age, and is
     an enthusiast in poetry, with a memory truly astonishing considering his multifarious reading,
     I consider him highly capable of detecting what were blemishes in a harum scarum story like
     mine,—We read it for the purpose of criticizing closely, We all doubted the propriety of Giant
     Scoop in the outset of the piece, yet all agreed that the ridiculous thought was not without
     merit, only perhaps out of place. Previous to this I had shown it to Mr <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RogersSamuel" title="Rogers">Rogers</a>, author of 'The pleasures of memory', and he,
     even then, in its ruder state, said that it would probably be well recieved if published, but
     that it was evident that I had not taken the pains with it which might be taken. I then wrote
     the whole out again with great emendations, in which state Mr. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Lofft">Lofft</a> gave the opinion which I very barely stated to
     you. I took his hints and the others in conjunction, and wrote <em>the whole out
     again</em>, still in the mending way with additions and curtailments, and in this new dress,
     without the personage above mentioned, Scoop, I submited the piece to the calm, judicious, and
     candid Mr <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Park">Park</a> of Hampstead (He had seen the giant
     long ago and said nothing in his praise, which I know how to understand) He was decidedly of
     opinion that the thing would do me credit, and at the same time pencil'd his doubts and
     remarks. With this encouragement I once more wrote out the whole; gave the brat a name; and
     offer'd it to My Bookseller. I know of nothing which can now retard its ultimate appearance
     before the world. (<a href="../letterEEd.25.256.html">letter 256</a> of <em>The Letters of Robert Bloomfield</em>: to
      <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary Lloyd Baker">Mary Lloyd Baker</a>, 16 January 1811)</p></blockquote>
    <p><span id="d22e1308"><!--anchor1--></span>Being new to the tour-poem and of inferior class to his readers, Bloomfield did not dare to
     be facetious and mock the public's cultural expectations of such a book and of the place it
     described. Abandoning his hudibrastic lines, he left out the most characteristic and individual
     of his poetic voices, submitting to male critics rather than reproduce in public the verse
     inspired by his chatty, female correspondents. What was lost in this new excision from
      <em>The Banks of Wye</em>, however, was an idiosyncratic response to the West Country that
     remade the poetic traditions in which that region had previously been compassed and that
     questioned the conventional pieties of the gentlemanly tour. Without this response, and lacking
     the prose journal and extensive illustrations intended for the tripartite publication,
      <em>The Banks of Wye</em> was a slighter and less original book than first planned.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1317"><!--anchor1--></span>The abandonment of the tripartite Wye-book and the excision of Old Scoop
     revealed that Bloomfield was unable to continue in a direction in which his writing took comic
     flight away from his homeground. He was not helped by those arbiters of politeness and
     propriety, the reviewers: 'the author's humour is generally very poor; and the language of it
     too coarse even for his honesty of style' declared the <a href="Review_Eclectic_Review.html"><em>Eclectic Review</em></a>,  while the <a href="Review_Critical_Review.html"><em>Critical Review</em></a> spoke of 'bathos'
     and 'vulgarity' and singled-out offending phrases. In the second edition of the poem of 1813, perhaps in response to the reviewers'
     sniffiness about the colloquialisms, Bloomfield revised in favour of more formal, serious and
     socially conservative diction: thus he omitted a whimsical passage imagining a war between
     earth and gods:</p>
    <div class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">Celestial power with earthly mix'd;</div>
     <div class="indent3">Gods by the arrow's point transfix'd!</div>
     <div class="indent6">(III, 247-48)</div>
    </div>
    <p><span id="d22e1338"><!--anchor1--></span>He also added initial capitals to 'king' and 'heaven'. Elsewhere he redrafted to clarify
     meaning but, in the process, made the verse more Latinate and Thomsonian, as a topographical
     poem was expected to be (as a youth Bloomfield had been inspired to write by reading <em>The
      Seasons</em>). Thus the lines 'When a dark thunder-storm had spread / Its terrors round the
     guilty head' (II, 71-72 in the 1811 text) became, in 1813, 'A summer flood's resistless pow'r /
     Raised the grim ruin in an hour! / When that o'erwhelming tempest spread / Its terrors round
     the guilty head'. All verbal revisions in the editions published (or prepared for publication)
     in Bloomfield's lifetime are recorded as variants in the present edition, the copytext for
     which is the 1811 first published version.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1345"><!--anchor1--></span>The revisions are regrettable because they tend to cloak the innovative,
     common speech element of the poem in gentrified respectability. Bloomfield in fact understood
     better than did the prissy reviewers for polite journals, as Wordsworth and Byron also did,
     that a tour poem – whether the 'Epistle to Sir George Beaumont, Bart' or <em>Don Juan</em>
     — demanded informality, since it depended on the convention that it was a letter home from a
     traveller. And this was still more the case in view of the fact that Bloomfield was a commoner,
     a shoemaker rather than a lord, who aimed to be a man speaking to men (and who, revealingly,
     admired Wordsworth's colloquial 'The Idiot Boy'). Unlike Wordsworth (himself scorned by
     reviewers for his adherence to common speech) and still more unlike Byron, Bloomfield was
     dependent on powerful gentlemen who were his social superiors. He could not ignore polite
     disapproval and so he pruned some of his colloquialisms away. The published <em>Banks of
      Wye</em> of 1811 and 1813 suffered by this removal, the remaining comic slang seeming
     increasingly out of place in a poem that mostly conformed to approved poetic diction. </p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1354"><!--anchor1--></span>Despite its often stilted verse, time after time the poem flares into life for
     the space of a highly original passage. Bloomfield's sincerity to his own highly unusual
     viewpoint —a labouring-class man accompanying gentlefolk on a tour that labourers would never
     be able to take by themselves, let alone in such company—led him to see and say things that
     escaped most other Wye tourists. There is, for example, a brilliant meditation on the mind's
     relationship to place and time. Bloomfield had read and admired <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>:
     his Wye poem may eschew the first-person self-analysis of Wordsworth's famous Tintern lines,
     but it nevertheless also considers the effects on the reflective mind of recalling a spot of
     natural beauty and human history. In climactic verses on ruined <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RaglanCastle" title="Raglan castle">Raglan castle</a>, once the last stronghold of the Royalists in
     the Civil War, Bloomfield first evokes the triumph of nature over man's achievements, however
     violent and heroic they once were: </p>
    <div class="lg">
     <div class="indent3">Majestic Ragland! Harvests wave </div>

    </div>
    <p><span id="d22e1438"><!--anchor1--></span>The ivy embraces the stone; as the castle moulders, the plant prospers, until the monuments
     of martial valour are encased in a 'wilderness of leaves' and the sounds of human life give way
     to the stifling constriction of the creeper. These are sophisticated verses that demonstrate
     how much could still be achieved in the Augustan rhyming couplet. Partly this is a matter of
     allusion: Milton's serpent Satan is not far behind the snake-like plant that 'with pride
     upheaves' itself at the tower's expense. It's also a result of lexical vividness, rhetorical
     insistence and syntactical energy creating urgency: Bloomfield pressures his reader to feel
     awed and threatened by a nature that, in the figure of the ivy, represents the triumphant and
     vampiric power of death, supporting itself on the works of mankind. Yet, encasing the crumbling
     masonry, the ivy also configures a natural, growing memorial to a defunct human edifice. This
     is a post-Edenic fallen world, where nature is both beautiful (as in the glossiness of the
     leaves) and menacing because time, death and—in Miltonic terms—sin are fundamental to its
     growth. It is a world, too, in which nature and humanity (here represented by historical
     monuments to human deeds and achievements) are at odds.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1441"><!--anchor1--></span>It is now that Bloomfield ventures a meditation on time, history and nature
     that is akin to Wordsworth's and that may represent his response to reading <em>Lyrical

    </div>
    <p><span id="d22e1507"><!--anchor1--></span>'[O]ne solemn hour / . . . / Is pregnant with a thousand joys' is verbally close to
     Wordsworth's 'One impulse from a vernal wood / May teach you more of man, / Of moral evil and
     of good, / Than all the sages can' from 'The Tables Turned', although for Bloomfield it is the
     encounter with nature's overwhelming of humanity's works, rather than solely with its beauty,
     that makes visiting the spot so endlessly educative. The surprising word here is 'joys': as in
     Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey' the visitor unexpectedly derives joys from a scene that should,
     because it reveals the passing of time, produce melancholy. This is, then, no simplistic
     sightseeing event, no mere touristic picturesque, but a complex response that finds, as the
     paradoxical one/thousand phrasing suggests, a plenum of emotions and thoughts from a brief
     encounter. These emotions and thoughts are joys, despite the evidence of destruction that gives
     rise to them, because they fertilise a human activity that turns out to be less vulnerable to
     time than castles and towers are—the activity of reflection that vivifies the mind and restores
     the past in memory and that, though it may die with us, survives, in the form of 'legends' and
     tradition, as the stories, songs and poems that we make and that others repeat after us. And
     these, implicitly, renew the 'carols of joy' that long-dead denizens of the castle once sang
     with 'beauty's tongue'. This, of course, is an implicit poetic; Bloomfield was adding another
     turn to the traditions, legends and songs that allow us to redeem from oblivion the works of
     the past—and redeem ourselves as consciousnesses destined for oblivion. Carolling joyfully in
     the poem, he retrieves the songs of yore from the ivy's clutches. As a response to a Wye-tour
     this is as profound, but not as self-foregrounding, as Wordsworth's in his 'Lines Composed a
     few Miles above Tintern Abbey' to which it compares in its intimation of the ability of the
     human mind to overcome time's depredations when that mind, fertilised by an encounter with a
     temporally-shaped landscape, is prompted to reflect upon itself and assert its power of
     song.</p>
    <p class="indent1"><span id="d22e1510"><!--anchor1--></span>Profound though it is, Bloomfield's response to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Raglan" title="Raglan">Raglan</a> remains isolated, lost in a poem of occasional
     brilliance that was published without its more original lines and without the prose journal and
     sketches that should have accompanied it. Bloomfield missed a chance, owing to his booksellers'
     reluctance and his own inhibiting consciousness of what was proper for a labourer-visitor
     writing at the touring-gentry's behest. As a result it was easy to neglect the merits of his
     Wye: literary criticism, although idealising a fellow nature-poet's imaginative response to the
     Wye valley, damned the poem with faint praise. In the twentieth century, Bloomfield's
     reputation dwindled to nothing. His multimedia Wye texts, now published for the first time,
     show us both that this eclipse was not of his own making and that Wordsworth's egotistical
     sublime was not the only way to bring into being a new and distinctive response to landscape.
     The Wye, in Bloomfield's verse, prose and pictures, produced an original, humane and at times
     profound contribution to the visual and literary culture of the early nineteenth century.</p>

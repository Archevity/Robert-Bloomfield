I came from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> to
					this place on Tuesday evening and was prevaild on to promise to stay here on the Wednesday; but in the Afternoon of that day an
					express came from Ipswich to fetch <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> on particular business as a Councellor.
						<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftSarah" title="Mrs L">Mrs L</a> and Miss Finch wanted to go, and here again I was drawn into a fresh scrape,
					for I had not fulfilld my visit as to time, and so I agreed to go with them, The distance is 26 miles <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr L">Mr L</a> and I rode on the Dickey, they drive their own Carriage, and hire horses. We
					arrived there at eleven at night, and returnd on Friday night. Yesterday (Saturday, and the day on which I first proposed to be
					home) <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr L">Mr L</a> walkd with me to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a>, there
					I found your letter, a most wellcome one, as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a> had sent it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a>. I find them all well, but have not been to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="Mr Austins">Mr Austins</a> yet. I am going <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">now</em> when I have had breakfast,

					left <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">her</em> part of his property at the disposal of her Husband, has render'd her a more silly and ungovernable
					devil than before. Their case is a desperate one, and he is much to be pitied. We have dreadful thunder storms allmost dayly, how
					will you get home?—<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftSarah" title="Mrs L">Mrs L</a> has offerd to be my Banker, and I have accordingly sent relief
					to our fortress in the City Road. When I got to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> I saw <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a> going cross the Angel hill, he was then going to the post Office with his
					wife's letter for two pound as Usual!! and yesterday at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a> I found that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> had just written to me in Town, somthing perhaps concerning Mrs
					Austin. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> set out at 5 in the morning of saturday from London and
					reachd <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> by ten the next morning! so much for good legs. With respect to my
					coming round your way I doubt that is now impossible. I never saw Cambridge and [line obscured] there; besides, If you [words
					obscured] at all, it will not be before I could get to you, which would not be earlier than Friday next, and then we could not
					reach Town till Tuesday I believe, if this finds you at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr Weston's">Mr Weston's</a>, you may be sure
					of my recieving your letter should you write again before Thursday, but not later. You must not expect me in Bedfordshire, And yet
					should you realy be induced or have allready agree'd to stay till tomorrow week, of course I should find you there if I come; And
					thinking that you may not be there, I will before starting for home on either road, write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr Weston">Mr Weston</a>. Your last letter does you credit, all but in the writing. I will endeavour
					to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldKitty" title="Aunt Kitty">Aunt Kitty</a>. And when I have visited the Farmers, will in a day or two
					return to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> and go a 'how d doing' there, and then write to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="shefford">shefford</a> and then ride home, and then tell you all about it and both then and now I am

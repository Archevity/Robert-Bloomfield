We left London at 3 on thursday last, and came home in 4
                    hours and a half. We left <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="Rob">Rob</a> well and I calld on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EvansJohn" title="Mr Evans">Mr Evans</a>, now Doctor Evans, who is totally lame from his chest downwards, yet he
                    contrives to perform the duties of his school, and the duties of the pulpit too. He about 20 years ago wrote his 'Sketch of the
                    denomination &amp;c', and sold it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrosbyBenjamin" title="Crosby">Crosby</a> for £20.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> When the latter broke and
                    died, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Baldwin">Baldwin</a> gave him or his assignees no less than £500 for the copyright!! So
                    that the Booksellers have been getting at least £100 a year by it for 20 years past! It still sells rapidly, and an edition now
                    printing will compleat Ninty thousand copies!—We were glad to receive your very interesting journal of your voyage, and your
                    reception amongst my friends and yours. You see what great movements may be accomplished by asking about them with vigour, and at
                    the right end. I join in the plan of improving yourself in every possible way. You are young and able, and though you know 3 times
                    as much as your father did at your age, you are capable of acquiring more, and that of usefull and solid stuff. Try to gain the
                    goodwill of every body, boys ands all; except the goodwill of the vile, the cunning and the vicious; if you should find such;
                    start from their intimacy boldly and let them see that you have a will of your own. We do not expect miracles from you, but we
                    anxiously wish and hope that you will succeed in gaining in the long run somthing like a livelihood, and never forget that the
                    line of life into which you are thrown is capable of almost unbounded improvement, if ever you should be able to take boarders
                    &amp;c &amp;c——We left <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="Rob">Rob</a> well, so he is settled—By the time you
                    receive this you can better judge what books we can send you to be of service besides Butler, and be sure tell us by what
                    conveyance whither by the Ramsgate coach or otherwise. I cannot say half what I wish for the post is going. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> has a cold and a headache, and I have stiff neck; that is all the bodily
                    complaint I have to make. Give my best regards to Mr Freeman and family and, we will write more next time, yours ever</p>
					<p align="right">Father—Rob Bloomfield</p>
					<p class="pnonident">I have scarcely time to tell you that we wish you to write <em>soon</em> and inform us how we are to direct to you,
                        and we will send you a pair of shirts and all we think you will much want besides. Yours ever</p>

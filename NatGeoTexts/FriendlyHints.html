      <p  style="margin-left:120px;">
Hark! The dread cry of 'fire!' floats on the wind,<br>
  Start'ling the Villagers, in sleep reclined.<br>
  Behold! Convolving flame with smoak ascends,<br>
  And consternation far and wide extends!<br>
  The frantic Mother, seized with terror wild,<br>
  Flees from her home;—she clasps her darling Child;—<br>
  Her terrors still increase, as on they press,<br>
  For every face betrays severe distress,<br>
  And mingled horror each sad breast assails,<br>
  As the devouring element prevails!<br>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">The lonely trav'ler, far away, descries</span><br>
  The vivid light that darts athwart the skies.<br>
  His country's love, perchance, his bosom warms:—<br>
  'Ah whence!' he sighing cries, 'these dread alarms?<br>
  'Mid all the wonders of this earthly range,<br>
  Can <i>wealth</i> produce such ills? 'Tis passing strange!<br>
  Can fruitful seasons make our case the worse?<br>
  Can <i>plenty</i> prove our ruin, prove a curse? <br>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">How grateful is the task the mind t'employ;</span><br>
  To trace from <i>wealth</i> the blessings we enjoy; <br>
  Gratuitously view the healing art<br>
  To suffering indigence its aid impart!<br>
  The mild philanthropist delighted sees<br>
  Unnumbered hospitals for dire disease;<br>
  But the prime blessing of the present age<br>
  Is the diffusion of the sacred page!<br>
  Whilst learning to the infant poor is given,<br>
  Religion points the anxious mind to Heaven.<br>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">WEALTH, like all human good, has its alloy:</span><br>
  It can give comforts, and it can destroy.<br>
  When boundless commerce made Old England great,<br>
  Wealth, like a torrent, rush'd into the state;<br>
  Brown Industry stood forth;—no more are seen<br>
  The barren heaths, the flow'r-deck'd commons green:<br>
  Proud cultivation now adorns the land,<br>
  And thick with corn the hills and valleys stand!<br>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">But <i>wealth's</i> uncertain as an April day!</span> <br>
  Riches make wings, and quickly fly away!<br>
  For the redundant produce of the land,<br>
  A glutted Market <i>now</i> has no demand.<br>
  Hence universal bankruptcies ensue;<br>
  Hence the appalling scenes that strike our view.<br>
  In vain the hapless Farmers seek relief:<br>
  Despair is their's, and unavailing grief!<br>
  They see their children beggar'd; <i>wealth</i> all gone;<br>
  Their prospects blighted, ruin'd and undone.<br>
  This, too, the dark incendiary views,<br>
  But views unmov'd with pity: crime imbues<br>
  His inmost soul, as, with malicious ire,<br>
  He gives their lives and properties to fire.<br>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">Our brave forefathers boasted hearts of steel;</span><br>
  They boldly fought and bled for Britain's weal;<br>
  In martial fields, by gallant WOLFE led on,<br>
  Their acts heroic deathless glory won.<br>
  Would they thro' paths of darkness thus have stray'd?<br>
  Would they such guilty projects ere have laid?<br>
  In War 'twas theirs to join with hand and heart—<br>
  Not play the midnight skulking coward's part!<br>
  Let not the hardy sons of Suffolk stain,<br>
  With foreign crimes, our GEORGE'S glorious reign!<br>
  Born a TRUE BRITON—bred in Britain's school—<br>
  He only in his people's <i>hearts</i> would rule! <br>
  Then, ever let his subjects' hands forego<br>
  The torch revengeful, and the assassin's blow;<br>
  And, sons of Norfolk, proud in manhood's boast,<br>
  Let not the honours of your name be lost;<br>
  But, cease, O cease, your sad misguided rage!<br>
  Blot not with guilt our fair historic page!<br>
  In <i>manly fortitude</i> sustain the blast—<br>
  The ills we suffer cannot,—will not last!<br>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">Since devastations evidently tend</span><br>
  To heighten woes they never can amend,<br>
  If want beset, if poverty enthral,<br>
  Consider those who had so <i>far</i> to fall;<br>
  Who, born to wealth, to every prospect fair,<br>
  Are sunk in gloom—in wretchedness—despair!<br>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">At death's approach, would you at last be blest,</span><br>
  O, keep a living conscience in your breast!—<br>
  Soon, soon, will this terrific storm blow o'er;—<br>
  Believe my words, though I am old and poor!<br>

<p>As I am of the Old School, firmly believing that <i>Providence rewards good works</i> , it has been my endeavour, in the preceding lines, to appeal to the best feelings of the human heart. I have ventured to say, that the present troubles “CANNOT, WILL NOT LAST.” When I reflect upon what the wealthy part of the community have done for the comfort of the <i>unportioned</i> poor, and upon the mental light which has been diffused around, my heart assures me that there is happiness in store for us; and, that we shall not, by a wanton destruction of property, and violation of the laws, be subjected to the severe punishment of returning to a savage state. Let us in humble confidence repose our trust in HIM, who “tempereth the wind to the shorn lamb.” </p>

		<div style="margin-left:120px;"> MAN'S sad necessity, destructive War,<br> Sweeps to the grave the surplus of his sons,<br> Where'er the kindly clime and soil invite<br> To Love; and multiply the Human Race.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Around the World, in every happier spot</span><br> Where Earth spontaneous gives nutritious fruits,<br> Her softest verdure courting human feet,<br> And mossy grots, beneath protecting shades,<br> The Stranger's envy, the Possessor's pride;<br> There, as increasing numbers throng each bower,<br> Frequent and fatal rivalships arise;<br> And ruthless War erects his hideous crest.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Soon as Appropriation's iron hand</span><br> Assays to grasp the Produce of the Earth;<br> And youths assert hereditary power,<br> Propriety exclusive, and in arms<br> League to defend their patrimonial rights,<br> Indisputable claim of Fruits and Fields<br> Contending, oft their massive clubs they raise<br> Against each other's life: often, alas,<br> The needy cravings of the unportion'd poor<br> Provoke their jealous wrath; relentlessly<br> Tenacious of their store, they shut him out,<br> 'Midst desart Famine, and ferocious Beasts,<br> To guard his life and till the steril soil;<br> And thus extend the range of human feet.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Still as Experience, in her tardy school,</span><br> Instructs the Shepherd and the Husbandman<br> To great increase their flocks and herds to rear,<br> To till the ground, and plant the fruitful tree<br> In slow progression rising into use,<br> Nurtur'd by Her the infant Arts appear.<br> While sage Experience thus teaches Man<br> The useful and the pleasant Arts of Life,<br> She in harsh lectures, in the frequent broil,<br> Enjoins her Pupil still to cultivate<br> The fatal, necessary Art of War.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> The Artizan, who from metallic ores</span><br> Forms the sharp implements to dress the glebe,<br> And prune the wild luxuriance of the tree;…<br> By him is made the sword, the spear, the shaft,<br> By Man worn to defend him against Man.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Most bless'd the country where kind Nature's face</span><br> In unsophisticated Freedom smiles:<br> Happy the tenants of primeval days<br> When young society is in its spring:<br> Where there is room and food for millions more,<br> Love knows no check, the votaries of Love,<br> The happy votaries of Wedded Love,<br> Know not the curse of peopled, polish'd, times:<br> The curse to wish their children may be few.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Sweet converse binds the cords of social love;</span><br> When the rude noise and gestures that ere while<br> Imperfectly express'd the labouring thought;<br> By social concourse are improv'd to Speech:<br> Speech, reasoning Man's distinguishing 	perfection;<br> Speech, the inestimable vehicle<br> Of mental light, and intellectual bliss;<br> Whence the fair fruits of Holy Friendship grow,<br> Presenting to fond Hope's enamour'd 	sight<br> The fairy prospect of perpetual Peace.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Advanc'd Society's prudential Laws,</span><br> The moral virtues of the enlighten'd mind,<br> And all the ties of Interest and of Love,<br> In vain conspire to nurse their favourite Peace, <br> And banish dire Immanity and War.<br> Strong Nature's bent, continual increase,<br> Still counteracts Humanity's fond wish,<br> The perpetuity of Peace, and Love;<br> Alas! progressive Increase cannot last.<br> Soon mourns the encumber'd land its human load:<br> Too soon arrives the inauspicious hour;<br> The Natal Hour of the unhappy Man,<br> Who all his life goes mourning up and down<br> That there is neither bough, nor mud, nor straw <br> That he may take to make himself a hut;<br> No, not in all his native land a twig<br> That he may take, nor spot of green grass turf,<br> Where without trespass he may set his foot.<br> Now Want and Poverty wage War with Love;<br> And hard the conflict: horrible the thought,<br> That Love, who boasts of his all-conquering impulse,<br> Should have to mourn abortive energies... <br> But in proportion as Mankind increase,<br> So evils multiply: till Nature's self, <br> (The native passions of the human mind)<br> Engender War; which thins, and segregates,<br> And rectifies the balance of the world:<br> As thick-sown plants in the vegetable world,<br> With stretching branches wage continual War; <br> Each tender bud shrinks from the foreign touch<br> With a degree of sensitive perception;<br> Till one deforms, o'er-tops, and kills the 	other.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Like Summer swarms, that quit their native hives,</span><br> The offspring of increasing families,<br> Who find no room beneath their father's roofs,<br> No patrimony nor employ at home,<br> Colleagu'd in bands explore the desart wilds,<br> To seek adventures; or to seek their food:<br> If chance they meet with rovers (like themselves)<br> Whose home is far away in distant vales,<br> Behind the mountains, or beyond the lake;<br> Instinctively they war where'er they meet:<br> The friendly parley cannot intervene;<br> The unknown tongue does but create alarm:<br> With jealous fears, stern looks, and brandish'd 	arms,<br> They stand aloof: as birds of distant groves<br> At the strange note prepare for instant War.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> At first they skirmishing dispute the right </span><br> Of hunting in the unappropriate waste:<br> But every onset aggravates their hate;<br> Till each increasing force, whetting their swords,<br> With purpos'd malice seeking out the foe,<br> Alternate by reprisal and revenge,<br> Doubly compensate each discomfiture.<br> Yet seek not to attack each-other's home,<br> Where Age, and Infancy, in safety dwell:<br> They war but with freebooters: private Peace<br> And Female Covert, Valour scorns to assail.<br> But when in evil hour some female hand, <br> Whether by force of Love, or force of Arms,<br> Is led across the desart by the Foe;<br> The jealous fury kindles to a flame:<br> No longer sacred the domestic hearth:<br> Fire, Death, and Devastation, mark their way,<br> And all the horrid crimes of savage War.<br>
		<span style="margin-left:40px;"> Now War becomes the business of the State: </span><br> The most humane, the most pacific men,<br> Must arm for War, or lose all they hold dear:<br> The sorrows of the Aged, Infant cries,<br> And Female Tears, resistlessly prevail:<br> Can gentlest natures be in love with Peace,<br> When Love, most tender Love, excites to War?<br> No…When some lov'd and honour'd youth distress'd,<br> Raising his head amongst his arm'd compeers, <br> Tells that the well-known honourable Maid,<br> The Virgin Mistress of his dearest hopes,<br> Is ravish'd from him, borne by force away;<br> Though pierc'd with grief, yet nobly he exclaims,<br> 'Think not I wish to' embroil you in my 	fate:<br> For though not one of you espouse my cause,<br> I singly will attempt the desperate deed.<br> Farewell: I go to find my Love, or die!'<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Silent and motionless the legions stand,</span><br> By looks examining each-other's heart:<br> But soon a murmur through the ranks proceeds,<br> Swelling as quickly a terrific roar;<br> Like heavy waters breaking from their mounds,<br> A long, and loud, and inarticulate shout,<br> While every weapon vibrates in the air,<br> And hisses its fierce vengeance at the foe.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> The righteous cause admits of no delay;</span><br> No tardy foot impedes the immediate march:<br> The Enemy, not taken by surprise, <br> Wak'd by the watchful fears of conscious guilt,<br> On their frontiers await the coming foe.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Now at the near approach of threatening Death,</span><br> Full many a thinking, sighing, aching heart,<br> Indulges secretly the hopeless wish<br> For Life, and Peace...Alas! it cannot be:<br> To advance is to encounter dreadful danger;<br> But to recede, inevitable death;<br> His own associates would deal the blow:<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Thus led by Fate, behold upon the plain,</span><br> The adverse bands in view, and in advance.<br> Now Fear, Self-pity, and affected Courage,<br> Speak in their hideous shouts with voice scarce human;<br> Like that which issues from his hollow throat<br> Who sleeping bellows in a frightful dream.<br> More near their glaring eye-balls flashing meet;<br> Terror and Rage distorting every face,<br> Inflame each-other into trembling fury.<br><div class="indent4"> Soft-ey'd Humanity, oh! veil thy fight!<br> 'Tis not in Rationality to view<br> (Even in thought) the dire ensuing scene; <br> For Madness, Madness reigns, and urges men<br> To deeds that Rationality disowns.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Now here and there about the horrid Field,</span><br> Striding across the dying and the dead,<br> Stalks up a man by strength superior,<br> Or skill and prowess in the arduous fight,<br> Preserv'd alive:...fainting he looks around;<br> Fearing pursuit, nor caring to pursue.<br> The supplicating voice of bitterest moans,<br> Contortions of excruciating pain,<br> The shriek of torture and the groan of death,<br> Surround him; and as Night her mantle spreads,<br> To veil the horrors of the mourning Field,<br> With cautious step shaping his devious way,<br> He seeks a covert where to hide and rest: <br> At every leaf that rustles in the breeze<br> Starting, he grasps his sword; and every nerve<br> Is ready strain'd, for combat or for flight.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Thus list'ning to ward off approaching foes,</span><br> A distant whispering, sighing, murmuring sound<br> Salutes his ear, and to his throbbing heart<br> Soft tidings tells of tenderness and love.<br> For on that fatal day of vengeful ire,<br> At fearful distance following the host,<br> From either country came a female throng;<br> And now beneath the covert of the night<br> Advancing, guided by the voice of woe,<br> Where on the earth the wounded mourners lay,<br> With trembling steps and fearful whispering voice,<br> Each seeks, and calls him who she came to seek:<br> And many a fugitive, whom force or fear<br> Had driven from the Field, steals softly back,<br> Anxious to know the fate of some lov'd friend.<br> Mutual fears appal the mingled group,<br> Starting alternate at the unknown tongue: <br> They fear a foe in each uncertain form<br> That through the gloom imperfectly appears.<br> The mournful horrors of the doleful night<br> Melt every heart:…and when the morning's beam<br> Shews the sad scene, and gives an interview,<br> Resentment, that worst torment of the mind,<br> Resentment ceases, satiate wrath subsides.<br> Woman is present: and so strong the charm<br> Of weeping Woman's fascinating tears,<br> That though surviving Heroes' unwash'd hands<br> Still grasp the falchion of horrid hue,<br> And though their fallen brethren from the ground<br> May seem to call for Vengeance from their hands,<br> The impulse of Revenge is felt no more;<br> No more the strange attire, the foreign tongue <br> Creates alarm: for Nature's-self has writ<br> In every face; where every eye can read<br> Repentant Sorrow, and forgiving Love.<br> Their mingled tears wash the lamented dead:<br> On every wound they pour soft Pity's balm:<br> Ere Sorrow's tears are dried, they feel the spring<br> Of new-born joys, and each expanding heart<br> Contemplates future scenes of Peace and Love.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Long, even as long as room and food abound,</span><br> They interchange their friendly offices<br> For mutual good; reciprocally kind:<br> And much they wonder that they e'er were foes.<br> Still War's terrific name is kept alive:<br> Tradition, pointing to the rusty arms<br> That hang on high, informs each list'ning youth<br> How erst in fatal fields their Grandsires fell;<br> Childhood attentive hears the tragic tale;<br> And learns to shudder at the name of War.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> GUNPOWDER! let the Soldier's Pean rise,</span><br> Where e'er thy name or thundering voice is heard:<br> Let him who, fated to the needful trade,<br> Deals out the adventitious shafts of Death,<br> Rejoice in thee; and hail with loudest shouts<br> The auspicious era when deep-searching Art<br> From out the hidden things in Nature's store <br> Cull'd thy tremendous powers, and tutor'd Man<br> To chain the unruly element of Fire<br> At his controul, to wait his potent touch:<br> To urge his missile bolts of sudden Death,<br> And thunder terribly his vengeful wrath. <br> Thy mighty engines and gigantic towers<br> With frowning aspect awe the trembling World.<br> Destruction, bursting from thy sudden blaze<br> Hath taught the Birds to tremble at the sound;<br> And Man himself, thy terror's boasted lord,<br> Within the blacken'd hollow of thy tube,<br> Affrighted sees the darksome shades of Death.<br> Not only mourning groves, but human tears,<br> The weeping Widow's tears, the Orphan's cries,<br> Sadly deplore that e'er thy powers were known.<br> Yet let thy Advent be the Soldier's song,<br> No longer doom'd to grapple with the Foe<br> With Teeth and Nails.…When close in view, and in<br> Each-other's grasp, to grin, and hack, and stab;<br> Then tug his horrid weapon from one breast<br> To hide it in another:...with clear hands<br> He now expertly poizing thy bright tube,<br> At distance kills, unknowing and unknown;<br> Sees not the wound he gives, nor hears the shriek<br> Of him whose breast he pierces….GUNPOWDER!<br> (O! let Humanity rejoice) who much<br> The Soldier's fearful work is humaniz'd,<br> Since thy momentous birth...stupendous power.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> In Britain, where the hills and fertile plains,</span><br> Like her historic page, are overspread <br> With vestiges of War, the Shepherd Boy<br> Climbs the green hillock to survey his flock;<br> Then sweetly sleeps upon his favourite hill,<br> Not conscious that his bed's a Warrior's Tomb.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> The ancient Mansions, deeply moated round,</span><br> Where, in the iron Age of Chivalry,<br> Redoubted Barons wag'd their little Wars;<br> The strong Entrenchments and enormous Mounds,<br> Rais'd to oppose the fierce, perfidious Danes;<br> And still more ancient traces that remain<br> Of Dykes and Camps, from the far distant date<br> When minstrel Druids wak'd the soul of War,<br> And rous'd to arms old Albion's hardy sons,<br> To stem the tide of Roman Tyranny:…<br> War's footsteps, thus imprinted on the ground, <br> Shew that in Britain he, from age to age,<br> Has rear'd his horrid head, and raging 	reign'd.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Long on the margins of the silver Tweed</span><br> Opposing Ensigns wav'd; War's clarion<br> Dreadfully echo'd down the winding stream,<br> Where now sweet Peace and Unity reside:<br> The happy peasant of Tweed's smiling dale,<br> Whene'er his spade disturbs a Soldier's bones,<br> With shudd'ring horror ruminates on War;<br> Then deeper hides the awful spectacle,<br> Blessing the peaceful days in which he lives.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Since Peace has bless'd the villages on Tweed,</span><br> And War has ceas'd to drive his iron car<br> On Britain's shore, what myriads of men<br> Over the Eastern and the Western Seas <br> Have follow'd War, and found untimely graves.<br> Where'er the jarring interests of States<br> Excite the brave to advance their native land<br> By deeds of arms, Britons are foremost found.<br> The sprightly bands, hast'ning from place to place,<br> Gayly carousing in their gay attire,<br> Invite, not force the train of heedless youths,<br> Who crowd to share their jollity and joy:<br> To martial music dancing into death,<br> They fell their Freedom for a holiday;<br> And with the Rich and Great 'tis Glory charms,<br> And Beauty's favour that rewards the Brave.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> All the historic Records of the World </span><br> Are little more than histories of Wars;<br> Shewing how many thousands War destroy'd,<br> The time, the place, and some few great ones' names.<br> The mournful remnants of demolish'd States,<br> The Greeks, the Roman, and long-exil'd Jew;<br> Are living monuments of wasting War's<br> Annihilating power: and while they mourn<br> Their Grandeur faded, and their Power extinct,<br> To every State <em>memento mori</em> sounds.<br> From age to age the habitable World<br> Has been a constant theatre of War:<br> In every land with Nature's gifts most blest,<br> Frequent and fatal War's destructive rage.<br> So bland is fair Britannia's genial clime,<br> So liberal her all-protecting Laws,<br> So generous the spirit of her Sons,<br> So fond, so chaste, her Daughters virtuous love,<br> That human offspring still redundant grows,<br> And free-born Britons must contend for life.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> O! envy not the lands where Slaves reside,</span><br> Though their proud Tyrants boast of <em>peaceful</em> reign,<br> Where hard Oppression, freezing genial love, <br> Performs the work of War in embryo:<br> Let not mistaken fondness dote on Peace,<br> Preserv'd by arts more horrid far than War!…<br> Let the dull languor of the pale Chinese<br> Desert their Infants, and their <em>Peace</em> enjoy!<br> But, O! let Britons still in Love and War<br> Exert the generous ardour of the soul;<br> Protect the Fair, and softer Infancy.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> By strenuous enterprize, and arduous toils,</span><br> Is public safety purchas'd and secur'd.<br> Negative merit, 'I have done no harm,'<br> Is an inglorious boast: shall he who sits<br> Secure, enjoying Plenty in the lap<br> Of Ease, vaunt his recumbent Virtues?…He<br> Brand with harsh epithets the Warrior's toils? <br> While 'tis to them he owes sincerest thanks<br> For Peace and Safety, that are earn'd in War.…<br> As well might he who eats the flesh of Lambs,<br> And smacks the ichor in a savoury dish,<br> Boast his humanity, and say 'My hand<br> Ne'er slew a Lamb;' and censure as a crime,<br> The Butcher's cruel, necessary trade.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> In Battle, the chance-medley game of Death,</span><br> Where every one still hopes 'till he expires,<br> Less horror shocks the mind contemplative,<br> Than where, in slow procession's solemn pace,<br> Doom'd wretches meet their destin'd fate in bonds,<br> Who know the moment to expect the blow,<br> And count the moments 'till that moment comes:<br> Or where Oppression wages War, in Peace,<br> On the defenceless: on the hapless man<br> Who holds his breath but by another's will:<br> Whose Life is only one long cruel Death!…<br> Hardly he fares, and hopelessly he toils;<br> And when his driver's anger, or caprice,<br> Or wanton cruelty, inflicts a blow,<br> Not daring to look angry at the whip,<br> Oh! see him meekly clasp his hands and bow<br> To every stroke: no lurid deathful scene<br> In Battle's rage, so racks the feeling heart;<br> Not all the thunders of infuriate War,<br> Disploding mines, and crashing, bursting bombs,<br> Are half so horrid as the sounding lash<br> That echoes through the Carribean groves.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Incessant is the War of Human Wit,</span><br> Oppos'd to bestial strength; and variously<br> Successful: in these happy fertile climes,<br> Man still maintains his surreptitious power;<br> Reigns o'er the Brutes, and, with the voice of 						Fate,<br> Says 'This to-day, and that to-morrow 						dies.'<br> Though here our Shambles blazon the Renown,<br> The Victory, and Rule, and lordly Man;<br> Far wider tracts within the Torrid Zone<br> Own no such Lord: where Sol's intenser rays<br> Create in bestial hearts more fervid fires,<br> And deadlier poisons arm the Serpent's tooth;<br> In gloomy shades, impassable to Man,<br> Where matted foliage exclude the Sun,<br> The torpid Birds that crawl from bough to bough<br> Utter their notes of terror: while beneath <br> Fury and Venom, couch'd in murky dens,<br> Hissing and yelling, guard the hideous gloom.<br> O'er dreary wastes, untrod by human feet,<br> Without controul the lordly Lion reigns;<br> And every creature trembles at his voice: <br> When risen from his den, he prances forth,<br> Extends his talons, shakes his flaky mane,<br> Then whurrs his tufted tail, and stooping low<br> His wide mouth near the ground, his dreadful roar<br> Makes all the desart tremble: he proclaims<br> His ire—proclaims his strong necessity;<br> And that surprise or artifice he scorns.<br><span style="margin-left:40px;"> Unskill'd, alas! in philosophic lore,</span><br> Unbless'd with scientific erudition;<br> How can I sing of elemental War,<br> Or the contending powers of opposite<br> Attractions, that impel, and poize, and guide,<br> The ever-rolling Spheres: Animal War,<br> The flux of Life, devouring and devour'd,<br> Ceaseless in every tribe, through Earth, and Air,<br> And Ocean, transcends my utmost ken.<br><br><br>
	<div style="margin-left:0px;"> From obvious truths my Song has aim'd to shew<br> That War is an inevitable Ill;<br> An Ill through Nature's various Realms diffus'd;<br> An Ill subservient to the General Good.<br></div><div style="margin-left:0px;"> With sympathetic sense of human woes<br> Deeply impress'd, the melancholy Muse<br> With modesty asserts this mournful Truth:<br> 'Tis not in human wisdom to avert,<br> Though every feeling heart must sure lament,<br> The SAD NECESSITY of FATAL WAR.</div><br>

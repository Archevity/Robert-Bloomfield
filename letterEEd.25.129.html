                    left lately, and for the former 4 copies of the Letters;<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> I think the events of Domingo important in every point of view;
                    and to Europe perhaps more important than any of us apprehend at present.<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> As it is in a
                    great degree a political subject it is more in your way than mine;—All your
                    writings are so confoundedly violent, that I who have four years past made a
                    determination to be nutral in Politicks and Religion, have much ado to convince
                    myself that you ought to expect much assistance from such a cowardly fellow. And
                    it is because I differ in both the above particulars from the Author you first
                    put into my hands, that I do not feel myself acting a consistant part in
                    spreading his opinions. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PaineThomas" title="Mr P">Mr P</a> in my
                    estimation is the vainest of all authors. My circle of friends have long ago
                    regreted that his great mind should decend so as to disgust his readers by
                    boasting of himself. Perhaps when he laments the falling off of America from her
                    purity of principle he is only lamenting the utterly unavoidable effects of a
                    growing population there, or elsewhere, I believe that if perfect Republicanism
                    be not a dream, its durability is. I am thus commiting myself to you compleatly;
                    but it is to show you that I cannot propagate doctrines which I do not profess
                    either to believe or to understand. <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I must and will</em> be as

                    or subjects that involve not creeds and systems of which all the world knows I
                    have had small means of judging. You are fond of frankness, of which you set an
                    example both in your writings and your manners. You will therefore not be
                    offended or surprized that I should follow it</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> With great Respect, I remain, Sir</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Yours sincerely</p><p align="right"> Rob.

                        slave population, led by Toussaint L'Ouverture, had effectively achieved
                        independence, only for Napoleonic troops to attempt to re-establish control.
                        In 1802, after L'Ouverture's capture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines became
                        revolutionary leader. His forces defeated the French in November 1803 and on
                        1st January 1804 he declared Haiti independent. Paine, long an advocate of
                        the emancipation of slaves, had argued that Napoleon should give up his
                        attempt to reimpose slavery and withdraw French forces.  <a href="#back2">BACK</a></p></div>

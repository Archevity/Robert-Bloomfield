Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George Bloomfield">George
                        Bloomfield</a>, 29 February 1803<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">London. Feb 29th 1803.</p><p class="pnonident">Dear George,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Last week was remarkable for a combination of vexations and
                    unexpected troubles. My own health very midling amongst the rest <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="My Wife">My Wife</a> and the 3 elder
                    Children ill with bad colds, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="my poor Boy">my
                        poor Boy</a> had early last week an unusual swelling come on his right
                    knee, and the surgeon tells me that it is in a fair way to be a White swelling
                    if the means he takes do not stop it. We apply night and morning a large
                    poultice of Vinegar, Water, and Oatmeal, which draws it full of pimples, and
                    those pimples are to subside, and then to have them raised again by the same
                    means: he gives me no hope of its speedy ammendment. this is one of my serious
                    troubles. I had two holidays last week but was too ill to make my visits which
                    had been defer'd or to write, or any thing else but think. On Friday, the day
                    after the Holidays, I expected a busy day at the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#SealOffice" title="Seal Office">Seal Office</a>; and so I found it with a
                    vengeance. I had eat no breakfast, and the Mob of Lawyers made me perfectly
                    savage: at One o'clock we shut the Office, but shut in between 40 and 50 people,
                    and did not get through the Work for 3 quarters of an hour after one. I then
                    grew faint, and knew if I walkd home to the City Road that my Wind and
                    indigestion would get the upper hand of my Stomach, and should eat no dinner; so
                    I put into the Cook's in Salsbury Court and eat heartily. by this time there was
                    no time to go home and then to Temple Bar again by 4; so I sulkd away the time
                    in St George's Fields, and then took another 3 hours' Mobbing at the Office,
                    having seald during the day nearly 1100 Writs! by far the busiest day (if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenWilliam" title="Mr A">Mr A</a> is to be credited) that have
                    occurrd for eight years past. Returnd to my sick house, tired and insufferably
                    disgusted. At home I found a Letter from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Troston" title="Troston">Troston</a>, not quite the thing and your most melancholy tidings, and—to
                    crown all, a young Man in the neighbourhood fourced on me a M:S. book of poems
                    for me to read and to give my judgment of, which accorded with the feelings of
                    the moment, being a doleful string of Elegies as black as midnight—This I shall
                    call Black Friday—Another trifle had displeased me. I had found in the Morning
                    Chronicle a bit of news put there by some fool or other that 'Bloomfield the
                    poet has been recently appointed to a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">handsome</em> situation in
                    the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#SealOffice" title="Seal Office">Seal Office</a> in the Temple, thus
                    he has not courted the Muses unsuccessfully!'<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> Your letter made it still worse by shewing me that
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GedgePeter" title="Peter">Peter</a> had either <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">originally</em> printed this wonderfull piece of news,<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> or else had
                    made it worse by adding to it what is as false as the Chronicle's '<em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">handsome</em> appointment' is ridiculous. This story has served
                    the Herald <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">two</em> days, the first to say I was there, and the
                    next to say I had resignd it!!—tis useless to be angry, but if the Asses that
                    meddle with another mans business before they know it were buried three times as
                    deep as your poor Wife, I would not were [i.e. wear] black for them.—What <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GedgePeter" title="G">G</a> says in his paper is false, thus,
                    because <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">confinement</em> is not my objection, and I hope and
                    trust that it is well known to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Duke">Duke</a>. Extreem publicity
                    begins to be more and more disgusting to my feelings, and these boobys make it
                    worse.—The Good Man at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#EustonHall" title="Euston">Euston</a> will be
                    here soon, and then I shall know how I am to proceed. His last letter said that
                        '<em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">he was sorry I was going to leave it at all</em>.'
                    circumstances made it absolutely necessary to reply that I would not leave it,
                    at least untill I see him—thus we stand now—<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JennerEdward" title="Dr Jenner">Dr Jenner</a> is in Town, and has
                    written to me. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PerkinsBenjamin" title="Dr Perkins">Dr Perkins</a>
                    plagued me by publishing my name with his Tractors, till I wrote to him to
                    forbid it. my cough plagues me, and I have no time to write down my Rhimes, I
                    have enough on my mind to craze a saint, but I feel my soul soar above it all—I
                    know that I shall triumph—and 'that Spring will come and Nature smile
                        again'.<a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> God

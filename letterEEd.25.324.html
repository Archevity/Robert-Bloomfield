Got there just as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> returnd from his
                    first morning's trial. Dined, and went with him to the school at one and staid
                    till 5. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> exerted
                    himself much more than I could have believed had I not witnessed it. He was
                    totally unprovided with slates, and with half his quantity of Books. He had to
                    meet 60 Boys without knowing a single face amongst them, 30 of these composed
                    the late town Charity-school, and 5 or 6 from the workhouse, and these 36 were
                    by far the most abandon'd and audacious rascals I ever beheld in my life. Not
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">one</em> of them had the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">least</em>
                    knowledge of the system, nor did they want. It was utterly impossible to keep
                    them in squares or order, so they made game of the plan, and almost defied the
                    master. I assisted him when they had made me angry enough, by pushing half a
                    dozen at a time into square and some degree of subjection, this, with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles's">Charles's</a> arm with a good
                    stick at the end of it, at last brought them to a little silence. I also stood
                    guard over the nessisary door; and the front door at the time of dismissal,
                    compelling them to retreat in order and by name. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> the schoolmaster is
                    not anything like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a>
                    any where else, he is quite another creature, as I always told you. He read
                    prayers with a voice and manner that would have done honour to a parson, and
                    made them sing the last verse of the 100<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> psalm. We returnd
                    home to his lodgings both out of heart at seeing what scoundrels he had to
                    govern, and the task he had undertaken. He however consented that I should
                    return to town to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AnsteadMiss" title="Miss Ansted">Miss Ansted</a>,
                    and write my opinion of the case to Mr Sandilands. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> lookd completely
                    pale and faggd, and dreaded the next day intirely by <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">himself</em>.</p><p align="center">—Tuesday—</p><p class="pnonident">Caled on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AnsteadMiss" title="Miss Ansted">Miss Ansted</a> to report
                    progress, and wrote to Mr Sandilands, that for so young a lad to tame 60 of the
                    worst boys I had ever seen was not to be expected without an immediate assistant
                    to help him the organization and to get some of them in training &amp;c
                    &amp;c—</p><p align="center">—Wednesday—</p><p class="pnonident">Went to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Putney" title="Putney">Putney</a> again; found Mr S had
                    attended to my representations, and promised an assistant &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> had gone through his
                    Tuesday's work better than he expected, but the boys were still very unruly, and
                    yielded to nothing but wooden arguments: but it fell out luckily for him that Mr
                    Sandilands was in the girls school and heard the young hellhounds roaring and
                    swearing in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles's">Charles's</a>
                    department! He came round to know if it was possible that the noise he had heard
                    could come from the boys? 'Oh yes indeed Sir, I could govern the younger part of
                    them who are much the best, but the Charity schoolboys are abominable,
                    particularly these five.' Mr S. collard the chickens one after another, and
                    threshd them severely with his stick. So your Brother has a parson for his
                    whipper-in! On the day when I arrived [word cut off] had dismissed his Lions,
                    and being half holiday we had a walk, and much conversation; he seemd quite
                    cheerfull, and lookd well, and much more determined from the opposition he had
                    met with. He had begun to train 4 pickd boys for teachers who promised well, and
                    evinced a wish to learn, particularly one little fellow of the name of
                    Bussell—promised to go to him again on Saturday—walkd al the way home, after
                    walking from Hyde Park in the morning.</p><p align="center">—Thursday—</p><p class="pnonident">Confoundedly weary, but in good health, having no stomach complaint, writing this
                    scribble all the afternoon, and intend to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> tomorrow who
                    does not yet know that I am in town! For I was determined to do one thing at a
                    time. Diary to be continued—Thursday night Apr 2d—</p><p align="center">—Miscellaneous—</p><p class="pnonident">Mr S. askd <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> if he did
                    not want a cane? Ch. yes Sir I do sadly. S. Well Ill take care you shall have
                    one.—The inclosed letter would have been posted if I had not been here. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AnsteadMiss" title="Miss Ansted">Miss Ansted</a> laughs at Mrs Napier's
                    proposal and says that in these things ladies are as mean as dirt, much more
                    than they would with menial servants. She gives her own servant 10 guineas. And
                    little Mary Hawyes at the age of 19 is out at service at 6 pounds. Aunt George
                    has had a narrow escape for her life, being blown into a ditch on Farnham heath
                    on the 4<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of March during the storm, when she stood to her
                    knees in water from eight in the evening till eight in the morning, when she was
                    relieved by some man who pulled her out and gave her some Brandy.</p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add. MS 28268, ff.

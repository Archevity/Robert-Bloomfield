					could not contrive to send the ointment until Tuesday's Coach. It is from Apothecaries Hall, but I did not get the spermacity
					because I suppose that is easily had at Worthing.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I dined yesterday at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Hampstead" title="Hampstead">Hampstead</a> and had many kind enquiries after your
					health, &amp; that of the Children. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldElizabeth1789" title="Bet">Bet</a> is come from her place rather
					out of health, and spent the afternoon here to keep company with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary">Mary</a> she
					is very well. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> is bad with a cold, and with that cough which she
					has had so long. It don't get worse. Sister <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteAunt" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> is begining to
					grumble, and has begd the favour of our mattress for a while, it is going to night. A Mr Harris, with whom and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EvansJohn" title="Mr Evans">Mr Evans</a> I visited <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DibdinCharles" title="Dibden's">Dibden's</a>, is now down at
					Worthing, at the rent of sixteen guineas for six weeks. I should not wonder if Mrs Park should go before the summer is out.
					Perhaps if you cook'd for yourselves it might sometimes be more agreeable but you will endeavour to look over little things. I am
					happy to hear that you go out, and enjoy your walks: have either of you bathed yet?—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have another letter from Cousin Isaac at New York, who has sent his poor old Mother <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seventeen
						Guineas</em>!! There's a Boy for you, after being lost to his friends for so many years! Poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a>, may be to you quite as good, if he lives.—<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Dr Young">Dr Young</a> call'd yesterday and seems anxious to hear of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a>, I shall tell him tomorrow how you proceed, and then write, if
					necessary. Your prises as to provisions are much like ours therefore as you must have provision if at home, the real weekly
					expence which may be term'd extra is your lodging and coals which at 16s pr week for three months is but about ten pounds, and
					your carriage down and home about £8, now if they raise your rent we may still do the whole for thirty pounds; courage girl,
					courage. I am not sorry that the knee is discharging if it satisfies you. love to the younkers. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="hannah">hannah</a> writes a very good and sensible letter, but she puts no stops to her
					sentences. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> We shall have about a Dozen Roses on all the trees, the moss rose died, and the sweet briar recover'd. the Broad
					Beans are in Blossom. the large Lupines which we thought would be yellow are a pale pink, and are a foot and a half high. I have
					planted 30 seedling stocks, and set scarlet Beans half round the grass plat, to form an arbour on one side up against the dead
					cherry tree. Both thistles are growing fast. And now, as a bit of a secret I will hint, that Mr Jefery has written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EvansJohn" title="Mr Evans">Mr Evans</a> to say, that in about 3 weeks he is coming to town with a Chaise to bring a
					relation, and to say how happy he should be if Mr B would accept of a ride down with him to Worthing! it is very likely therefore
					that I shall accept the offer, both cheap and agreeable. but do not build upon it, nor disappoint the children. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ChurchJoseph" title="Your father">Your father</a> is well.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Love to you truly</p><p align="right">Rob Bloomfield</p><p class="pnonident">Where will you stow me if I come? I have been talking about setting up all night in a cupboard.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I send patterns of the pinafores, the smallest pattern would make a gown of my choice, when dare you wear such
						a thing?</p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add.

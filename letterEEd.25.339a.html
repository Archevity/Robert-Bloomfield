<p>
When flowering shrubs their spangled livery wear<br>
And natures music charms the listning care<br>
In this gay prime the songsters of the groves, <br>
In dulcet music urge their little loves, <br>
On sportive wings they gaily fly in pairs, <br>
Their Nests to build with anxious hopes and fears<br>
Next o’er the blooming fields they search for food 270<br>
To hush the clamours of the callow brood.— <br>
Their offspring fledged, with joy from spray to spray, <br>
To trust their downy wings they now assay.— <br>
Repeated efforts soon their fears efface, <br>
They fly, tis Done, the parents duties ceace.— <br>
Thus the instinctive powers the scene displays<br>
Excites our admiration and our praise. <br>
Mercy and wisdom throughout our nature shine, <br>
Stamp’d with the great creators power divine. 280<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align:right">[catchword ‘In’]</p>
<p>[on the verso – prose notes in a more mature hand:]</p>
<p> I have often been of A party to go down the river our Voices or instruments were mock’d by Echo, that river <a href="#4"> [4] <a name="back4"> </a>has that quality in a Great Degree, but its Shores are uneven and unwooded, and no Striking objects to gratify the Eye if We except Santon Cathedral <a href="#5"> [5]<a name="back5"> </a>&amp;c but for Clearness, sound, and Sharp, Sweet air, it is not excelled by any Water I ever saw—
</p>
<p>[enclosure 3; in what appears to be George’s mature hand, on the same paper as enclosures 1 and 2, headed ‘General View of Summer &amp;c’, page numbered 16, no side numbers.]</p>
<p>
In this blithe time the invalid will find, <br>
Rural Delights a cordial to the Mind, <br>
In healthfull walks or rides inhale pure air<br>
On sunny hills, or Sylvan Vallies fair—<br>
May range those banks, where proud in days of yore<br>
A Gothic Structure graced each Vardand <a href="#6"> [6]<a name="back6"> </a> shore<br>
And many a ruin Lingers still to tell<br>
The Cloisterd path—the arch—or gloomy cell<br>
May launch his bark, on ouses crystal tide<br>
Along his streams, with some gay party glide, <br>
Breath Musics sounds adown the Liquid plain<br>
While echo sweetly vibrates every strain<br>
With kindred harmony each bosom glows<br>
And health impregneats every brees that blows<br>
Delight and joy thus elevates the Mind<br>
Unlike gross joys they leaves no <i>sting behind</i> <a href="#7"> [7] <a name="back7"> </a></p>

					<p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>MS: private collection. Date from contextual evidence: the letter enclosed verses published, at Faux’s instigation, in 1820 as <ref target="../HTML/thetford.html"> <cite>Thetford Chalybeate Spa. A Poem by a Parishioner of St. Peters</cite> </ref> (1820). In 1827 Faux recalled urging George to attend the laying of the foundation stone of the new pump room in Thetford, an ceremony which took place on 13 September 1819. See Letter 412. In 1827 Faux considered forwarding poems and letters by George that were in his possession for publication in William Hone’s <cite>Every Day Book</cite>: this letter may have been one of these. See Letter 412 for Faux and the <cite>Every Day Book</cite> publication. See Letter 360a for George acknowledging Faux’s assistance. See Letter 80a for the 1802 letter from Nathaniel to George that this letter enclosed. <a href="#back*">BACK</a></p>

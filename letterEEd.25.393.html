		<p class="pnonident">Sir, </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> It was out of my power to answer your letter of yesterday, so                   promptly as you desired, in consequence of being away from home. At the distance
                    of twenty-four years, I should hesitate to speak very positively as to matters                    of conversation: but I am relieved from this difficulty by a memorandum made at
                    the time, in my own copy of the second edition of the Farmer's Boy, in 1800,
                    which I will here transcribe.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> 'This poem was first offered to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BentWilliam" title="Bent">Bent</a>, in Paternoster-row, with a                    request to know his opinion of its deserts: but this he declined, in a short                    note, which was returned to Mr. B. in the course of a week, along with his MS.                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DillyCharles" title="Dilly">Dilly</a> was next applied to, who
                    refused to have any concern in publishing it, but recommended the slighted     author to take his production to Phillips, who probably might print it in the      Monthly Magazine. But as the poet foresaw that in case it was accepted for     insertion he should have to pay five or six shillings for obtaining a copy to       send to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="his mother">his mother</a>, which was   his prime object, he preferred sending the MS for her inspection to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="his brother">his brother</a> at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a>, who fortunately got it conveyed to the eye of Mr. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Lofft. Mr. L.">Lofft. Mr.     L.</a> was delighted with its merits, communicated it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillThomas" title="Mr. Hill">Mr. Hill</a>, and it was immediately
                    recommended to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Hood">Hood</a> for
                    publication.'</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> With the above memorandum I will extract the following note:</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> 'To <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft's">Mr. Lofft's</a>    protection and encouragement it was primarily owing that a production so morally  and poetically estimable as the Farmer's Boy has struggled into day; but to the
                    modest author's faithfulness of delineation, felicity of diction, purity of
                    sentiment, and refined simplicity of taste, it will stand indebted for
                    'aye-enduring fame.''</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I had not heard of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft's">Mr.  Lofft's</a> decease <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> till your announcement of it, and I grieve to hear of it  from a variety of considerations. Eight of his letters to me, which chiefly have relation to his poetical protégé, I have looked out, and when occasion serves    they shall be placed in your hands. I do not remember to have seen the verses     entitled PERPLEXITY, or the essay occasioned by some insurrection in    America <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The subscription papers shall be circulated where I can                anticipate any success.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I cannot decidedly say whether the MS. of the Farmer's Boy was        ever taken to the editor of the Monthly Magazine; but I should think that some    of the letters which passed between his brothers and himself (a transcript of  which I transmitted, with his letters to me) would be likely to settle the question. <em>This</em> I can decidedly say, that I never heard him  repeat the sarcasm ascribed to that editor, nor did I ever know him give vent to      any resentful feeling against him or any other person. Indeed I verily believe    that he had too catholic a benevolence for human kind to allow himself to foster   an emotion of resentment towards any human being; and when he did speak of his   early struggles, he spoke of them with much complacency. Perhaps the rustic     anathema, in his 'Neighbourly Resolution', may comprise the amount of his
                    indignant feelings, while in his 'First View of the Sea' he breathes a christian
                    supplication for that wisdom which would 'teach him to forgive'. <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> That we may all be taught to do so, is the hearty prayer of                     yours,</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> With much sincerity,</p>

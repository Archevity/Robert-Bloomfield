		<br/><div class="letter"><h3>11. Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George Bloomfield">George
                        Bloomfield</a>, 7 November 1798 <a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">London,  Nov 7, 1798</p><p class="pnonident">Dear George,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I finishd my last rather abruptly for want of time. — If I had
                    given my little piece to Mr. ******* even supposing that he would have accepted
                    it, it would then have taken perhaps six months at least, by monthly
                    continuations, before it would all have been printed. My chief pride would have
                    been to have sent <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a> a
                    printed copy; but, at the above rate, one copy only would have cost six
                    shillings: I therefore send it as it is. I never wrote it out but once. I have
                    no copy of it, except in my memory. You will find the copies of my letters to
                    the parties miserably blotted, they were written in haste, and I meant to have
                    transcribed them, but had not time.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Having never been instructed in grammar, perhaps it may abound in
                    faults of that kind which I am not aware of. The management of stops I don't
                    pretend to. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I desired you not to show it for this reason; because I think it
                    would look awkward to give it even to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a> without some kind of introductory letter.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You will perceive that the information I principally wanted to gain, I could not gain; that is, how to go about printing such a thing, and what
                    it would cost. But as I could not send <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a> a <em>printed copy</em>, I don't trouble myself
                    much to know whether it was want of merit, or want of patronage that made me
                    fail.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You say you find pleasure in reading it, perhaps it arises
                    principally from this: you know all the situations, circumstances, and persons
                    introduced into it. I wish that pleasure may continue to you, and such of our
                    friends as may happen to get hold of it.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;">All well, your affectionate brother,</p>

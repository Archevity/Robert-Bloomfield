			<h3>89. Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George Bloomfield">George             Bloomfield</a>, 23 June 1802<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3>
			
			<p align="right">City Road, London. June 23rd 1802</p><p class="pnonident">Dear George </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I wishd much for information respecting the Old House and am                    oblidged to you for your letter. If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MothersoleMr" title="Mothersole's">Mothersole's</a> little crum of a Soul hankers after a piece of the  Garden, and if he was actually to get it, he could go no further; and his   getting it seems to me very improbable. As to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="Austin's">Austin's</a> claim, that has no   hold of the House, thatchd or unthatchd, untill you and I are unable to pay his   demand. This too is not likely to happen.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I feel, that in the eye of generosity I have not acted right in       <em>receiving</em> interest here for my Money, and leaving you     to <em>pay</em> interest for what we borrow'd. but I acted with a    view to policy, to be able to answer such questions as I had reason to expect                    would be put to me. Thus I receive £8 per Annm. for 200 in the 4 per cents,    which I trust will be there untouch'd, and receive some additions, and perhaps     at some future day may be transformd into a Cottage and Close. Is this a dream   of prudence, or of avarice?</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Be that as it will I feel as I ought in beeing able to shelter     our parent stem from the rains of another Winter. I will send with the Budget      sufficient for the purpose.—</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ShieldWilliam" title="Mr Shield">Mr      Shield</a>, he is a man simple and unaffected in his manners to a striking                    degree, and ready to assist where he can. I showed him the songs and left them                    with him; he says they want some trifling amendment in the Bass, which he will   do—then asking if the three which I gave him were all <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> had composed, I                 produced the scetch of the 'Highland Drover.' this he seems to think adapted for           <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#IncledonCharles" title="Incledon's">Incledon's</a> voice and when I     repeated the words he was more confirmed in the notion. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> I  left them all, and shall hear from him soon—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ShieldWilliam" title="Mr Shield">Mr Shield</a> was so pleased with my               Poll Rayner that he has set it long ago, and has it by him, (perhaps unfinishd,) <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a></p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Young <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BirdIsaac" title="Mr Bird">Mr Bird</a> brought    me a note from you. Give our kind respects to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BirdIsaac" title="Mr Bird">Mr Bird</a> and family, and say that we     feel truly the loss of so kind and hospitable a friend as our late Aunt, and                    remember all favours from Susan and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LockwoodEdward" title="Mr and Mrs Lockwood">Mr     and Mrs Lockwood</a>, to whom as to you, we wish to remain    affectionately</p>

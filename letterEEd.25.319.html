		<br/><div class="letter"><h3>319. Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles Bloomfield">Charles Bloomfield</a>, 3 August 1817<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Sunday. 3 Aug. 1817</p><p class="pnonident">My Dear Charles,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I know well what it is to write a letter one day and expect news
                    the next, and then have to write again, and perhaps still in uncertainty. This
                    is somthing like your present situation.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I received yours by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Mr Inskip">Mr
                        Inskip</a>, last night, and am glad to hear that you are well. I think you
                    have done perfectly right in going to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Putney" title="Putney">Putney</a>; I wanted news from that quarter sadly. You will not receive
                    or <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">read</em> this perhaps till Monday evening when you will have
                    posted one to me!! This is vexatious, but we cannot help it now, or at any other
                    times if circumstances turn out so as to acquire a quick interchange of
                    letters.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> On the very day that you saw <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Inskip">Inskip</a>, I waited on Mr West at Noon,
                    I there found that he had several <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">written</em> applications for
                    the situation, and that he had waited, (or said he had waited) for our
                    determination!—We then <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">positively</em> agreed to wait for my
                    final answer till next Thursday the 7<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>, and I was going
                    instantly to write to you on the subject, but he saved me the trouble by sending
                    me, in less than three hours after I had left him, the following note. </p><p class="pnonident">'Sir</p><p class="pnonident">Considering after you was gone it would be very inconvenient for me to wait till
                    next week before an answer would be given whither <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Mr Charles">Mr Charles</a> could come or
                    not, and as I have, in waiting hitherto neglected my pupils, (having more than I
                    am able to attend to myself) I must therefore treat with one of the applicants
                    whose assistance I can have immediately. I sincerely beg your pardon for making
                    such imprudent propositions, and hope you will experience no inconvenience
                    therefrom.'</p><p align="center">Yours &amp;c—</p><p class="pnonident">Now the propositions were, as to time of answer, as I have before stated, and the
                    terms were, <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Board and Lodging, and Twenty pounds a year!</em>
                    But you see by what I now write that all connection with the Compton job is
                    entirely cut off. You have nothing to do with it in your wishes nor in your
                    calculations, and therefore I am glad that you have an inclination to persue
                    what you are now engaged in for some time longer. I am at the same time aware
                    that tomorrow (Monday) will be a hard day with you if Mr Sanderland and Mr
                    Johnson should meet!! Let them only be just and important and in whatever you
                    are most deficient, <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">that</em> you must the more assiduously try
                    to mend. I begin to think that you will get a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">right ernest</em>
                    school before many years go over your head,—and then if all your boys are as
                    sleepy as I am now, you must either make a confounded noise, or go to sleep
                    yourself in your own defence.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Love to self and sisters</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Your Dad.</p><p align="right">Rob Bloomfield</p><p class="l"><em>Address: </em><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Mr C Bloomfield">Mr C Bloomfield</a>, / 12 Welington Square, / the Foundling Hospital, / London.<br xmlns=""/></p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add.

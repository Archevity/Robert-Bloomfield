	<p align="right">Sunday night, October 22<sup>d</sup>. 1797</p>
	<p>Dear Mother</p>
	<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have constantly seen your letters to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a>, and have always been anxious  to hear of your wellfare, whenever you have appeared full of hopes and domestic  peace I have read your letters with pleasure, when you have been under the  pressure of ill health or bad prospects, the natural though painful conclusion is, I cant help you; you I believe often think over those things, you know the difficulty of keeping afloat in the dirty stream of the world, and I think you  know too the hearts of us all, that the power, and not the will, is wanted. — It    is sixteen years last June since I washed my old hat in the Horse-pond and sold my smock for a shilling to Sam Shelver's boy, and set off to London to turn   shoemaker, and I always remark that though I am aquainted with the principle alterations and deaths and changes, children grown to Men and Women since  &amp;c, the first thought that is, I mean whenever not thinking of other  things my mind returns to the country, for the first moment, it always presents  the old picture. I see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamUncle" title="my uncle">my uncle</a> master of the farm instead of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="my cousin">my cousin</a>, and can see in    imagination my old neighbours and things just as they were; fixing the memory  thus, brings in a strong point of view the quick successions and changes amongst  us; for if I had 16 years ago fixt my attention on a flourishing oak, or a whole   grove of oaks, the alteration might be disernable, but not striking. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RidlesworthHall" title="Ridlesworth hall">Ridlesworth hall</a><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> tells me is not far beyond  <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Fakenham" title="Fakenham">Fakenham</a> wood, I sometimes allmost   envy <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldKitty" title="Kitty">Kitty</a> her situation, being   always shut up in a garrot I am debard from the pleasures for which I have so strong a relish, but let me not grumble neither, for I have other pleasures,    perhaps quite my share; for at this very time I have pleasure in telling you    that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="my wife">my wife</a> is now fast recovering from a short indisposition that alarmd me a good deal at first, by   the simtoms her disorder showd we could not but suppose that the [illegible   word] pain she felt must proceed from the Gravel, but on applying to a surgeon   it did not appear to be that and he was obliged to use instrumental as well as    phisical help, whereby she is now almost well, and we shall again meet the  winter cheerfully. Our chief visitor is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ChurchJoseph" title="my Wifes Father">my Wifes Father</a>; he generally comes from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Woolwich" title="Woolwich">Woolwich</a> once or twice in a summer, and again at Christmas. He is always doubly welcome, for as well as being a   chearful, smiling man he is sure to more than pay for his entertainment by some   means or other, he works at boatbuilding in the king's yard at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Woolwich" title="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, he is 64 years old, is quite    harty, and when useless to work he is sure of being put on the superannuated     list, and receive 20£ a year as long as he lives, but this will not keep him and    he don't much like the prospect good as it is, for he is fixd upon independence,  he comes regularly the first Sunday in every month to his sisters at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Rotherhithe" title="Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</a>, I believe I have spoke  of those people before, they are well able to keep him, but he would rather     trust to himself, — My <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a>   goes to school, and I think shows signs of a good memory, the mistress  teach   them to repeat by heart, hymns, and moral verses, I like the method vastly; and like to hear them spoken by such young tongues, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> have learnd the morning   hymn 'Awake my soul and with the Sun',<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> and the evening hymn, 'Glory to thee my God this night',<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> she likewise recites Pope's 'Universal Prayer',<a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> and Goldsmith's beautiful verse, 'pitty the sorrows [of] a poor    old Man',<a href="#4"> [4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> my children give me a deal of pleasure now and I hope they  always will, — there are times, when the fire burns clear, and we are all well,  and our beer drawn good, and the candle fresh snuffd, that I feel myself quite  happy, when the muddy stream of the world, as I before calld it, seem quite   clear and palatable, indeed I always admired some verse I have somewhere seen,  beginning, 'The hearth was clean, the fire clear, the kettle on for tea',<a href="#5"> [5]</a><a name="back5"> </a>——You seem to dispair of hearing from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HingstonElizabeth" title="Bet">Bet</a>, but I think it very likely   that we shall, and that shortly; because when she went away she was to write   from New York if she could; she did not even know that she should go on shore   there, but perhaps sent coastways to philadelphia, in which case we were not to  hear from her till Autumn; my Landlady has a young brother who went for a     soldier, and was drafted off to go to the East Indies, they received a letter                     from him to day (Oct 29) dated as far back as last february; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HingstonElizabeth" title="Bets">Bets</a> will not be so long on its                     passage, we are expecting news every week, — </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Give our respects and remembrance to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverJohn" title="my Father">my Father</a>, tell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> I have not happened to have a musical shopmate for some years past, I have therefore made no  progress that way, my love to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldElizabethsisterlaw" title="his wife">his wife</a> and little   ones; and I remain your affectionate and dutiful Son</p>

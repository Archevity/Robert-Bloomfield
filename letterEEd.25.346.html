                    all I have of news that you may hear of us at least, I have waited day after day
                    always in hopes that you would find amusement and always in hopes of hearing
                    from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpMrs" title="Mrs Sharpe">Mrs Sharpe</a> but I have had no
                    letter. I therefore think that she may have written to Lady Mourdant on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles's">Charles's</a> account, and may
                    be waiting her reply.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a>—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Mrs Smith ought to have her a— whipt for the trick she has play'd
                    us, for on the Christmas morning she sent a small packet which she had from the
                    Windsorites containing letters to me, to you, to Miss Martin, and to Mrs Layman,
                    and containing 'Roxanna'! This she had at the time she was talking with us as
                    you started! I send you the two letters.—What else have I to say? Why that poor
                    little Peter died in a fit a day or two ago. The weather has been desperately
                    cold (at least to me) our mutton was frozen today before it was put to the fire,
                    and frozen again when it got upon the plate, I could not get on with it, and
                    therefore attack'd <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="your Mothers">your

                    few mornings past, I went down the garden to accomplish an ordinary task but
                    found on a sudden an inability to perform it, but whither <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">frost</em> had any thing to do with this I have not discovered. We are

                    the cook. I wish, my dear girl, you may be able to pass your time agreeably, and
                    to help if I send you ten shillings until better times turn up. Keep up your
                    spirits as I do, and by and by the Devil will be tired of kicking us, and then
                    we shall have it all our own way.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Yours with unceasing love</p><p align="right">Rob Bloomfield</p><p class="l"><em>Address: </em><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Miss H.

                        hoping Mrs Sharp (wife of James Sharp of Clare Hall, South Mimms) would seek
                        preferment for Charles from her relative-by-marriage Lady Mordaunt. Lady
                        Mordaunt was the daughter of Elizabeth Prowse (née Sharp), James Sharp's
                        sister. After Elizabeth's death in 1810, Elizabeth's estate at Wicken Park,
                        Northants—where Bloomfield had been a visitor—was inherited by Lady
                        Mordaunt's son Sir Charles Mordaunt. Lady Mordaunt lived until

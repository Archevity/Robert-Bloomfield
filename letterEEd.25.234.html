                        1808<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">The shortest day of y<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">e</sup> year 1808</p><p class="pnonident">To Mrs Baker,</p><p class="pnonident">Dear Madam.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> This, I hope will find you in your place at the fire side, and all who are dear to you, in the same circle, or a
                    similar one. How does <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Mr B.">Mr B.</a> &amp; the boy? the little girls, and the elders
                    of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#StoutsHill" title="Stouts Hill">Stouts Hill</a>? When I reflect on the times which have past since I wrote last I feel
                    vex'd, and lower'd in my own estimation, and therefore I will proceed without reflection, at least without that of the
                    retrospective kind, which I can least bear. Your venerable parents honourd me with a call twice, by whom I learnd that you were in
                    health &amp;c, and obtaind an address to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharp">Miss Sharp</a> then on a visit, and of
                    which I have made no use, but <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">now</em> write to her at her home. This is the way I treat my friends. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpWilliam" title="Your father">Your father</a> has been helping me with his advice as to the treatment of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="my boys">my boys</a> knee, so as to obtain strength by degrees, he is healthy and strong
                    except his lameness, and the rest are as I wish them, except when they give the rein to their tongues, and croud round the fire.
                    And now you will exclaim 'but how are you yourself?' Then honestly my dear friend I am but so so, I have now and then a staunch,
                    stupendous WindCliff* of a headache, that leaves me as weak and worthless as if I had been in a hot bath for a fortnight. Out of
                    these fits I rise with a spirit that lasts——5 hours! or a day and half! I believe you know that I have not budg'd an inch after
                    the Muses since April, but I have a strong notion that we shall be friends in the spring.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Many thanks for 'Marmion;' It comes, when compared with The Lay, like a round of beef after a Sirloin;<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> it
                    is not quite so tender, but it is right good stuff. In the 2<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> Canto I lookd and expected that he would, at
                    least poetically, rescue the poor girl from the dungeon; and when I left her there I felt a burning indignation, A little of it
                    was for the past, and the rest for the [word obscured] old lumps of iniquity who are saddled with the crime, or in case they call
                    off, for the historians who have told the Tale! I think the passage of Marmion through the Scottish Camp is a masterly
                    description; many other parts strike like lightning in a dark night, but I question if the local tales of superstition add <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">here</em> the interest they do in the Lay, and that for reasons I must leave you to find out.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I must now give you another proof of my great inattention of late to what would have spurd me once to immediate
                    action. I had long ago, a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperCharlotte" title="Miss Cooper">Miss Cooper</a>, and I have never answerd it! I
                    know many months ago that there were Songs for me at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrotchWilliam" title="Dr Crotch's">Dr Crotch's</a>, and I never went
                    for them untill the night before last. I know that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Mr Baker">Mr Baker</a> beat me hollow at
                    expedition and galantry for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperCharlotte" title="Miss C">Miss C</a> had the song at the time of its publication,
                    and very glad was I to hear it. And now will you for me give them the essence of this letter, and all the apology you can pick out
                    of it, saying moreover that I am above ground, and with a lively remembrance of pleasures and events, never more than now their
                    humble servant.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="my Musical brother">my Musical brother</a> in town for a while, and we are
                    making Harps by the dozen.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> With regard to Books, the first Vol of y<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">e</sup> Steriotype Edition has past my hands, but not

                    have lately been delighted with one on the subject of 'Robin Gray'. It work'd effectually at sensibility's pump, and did me a deal
                    of good, and at some future lucky hour I will certainly copy it for you.<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Once again pray speak to the good folks at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#FerneyHill" title="Ferney-Hill">Ferney-Hill</a>, and believe me

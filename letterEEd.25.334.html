Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles Bloomfield">Charles Bloomfield</a>, 21
                        April 1819<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>. April 21. 1819</p><p class="pnonident">My dear Charles</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Miss Humberstone brings this to London. It was well advised in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="your sister">your
                        sister</a> to leave your watch at home. Such fellows as you found there are realy very clever and expert. They would draw
                    your teeth and scoop out the white's of your eyes with the same dexterity. This is gaining wisdom by <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">experience</em>, a very dear way, but often an efficacious one.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You know my opinion of old with regard to giving up a certainty for an uncertainty. I dare not, nor ought not
                    advise you to any such step. I talk'd to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Inskip">Inskip</a> and Endersby on the subject, and to
                    Mr Peppercorn, thay all join in my opnion, which is as follows. First—If Mr Sandelands gave you his word that <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">he</em> would state your case, I would let him do it, and await his honour and punctuality; for if you write your <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">own</em> statement for him to present, he might say with some truth, 'This young man is in a great hurry indeed!
                    He might surely have waited to see the issue of my promise.'</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Secondly—Your examination day is just at hand; when if you come off with flying colours they will certainly vote
                    you some advance, and should that be even but Ten pounds, that ten pounds would go a long way in finding you clothes &amp;c,
                    or would enable you to have a room for your evening school supposing they refuse you the schoolroom.—And then, with your garden
                    for exercise, and this addition, you had better rest on your oars. There is not a person here who have heard of you, or your
                    character, but wishes as I do.—If you relinquish £50 per ann you throw yourself upon uncertainties. The Central school would give
                    you very little or nothing you would be out of employment, and your views deranged, you might get employment in 6 or 9 months, but
                    who keeps you the while? Perhaps poor old Dad! Who cannot help himself. And when your chance of appointment came it might be in
                    Scotland, in Ireland, in the north or west of England! And that just as I am growing an old man wishing to come to London in hopes
                    of associating with my children again before I go to the grave. If I give you advice contrary to your feelings no one gives advice
                    with more sincerity—wait patiently for your next examination, and write to me directly after.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have been <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">very</em> ill a few days since <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="your sister">your

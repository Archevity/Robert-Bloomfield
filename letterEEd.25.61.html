                    Bloomfield, 28 October 1801<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Troston  28 Oct 1801.</p><p class="pnonident">Sir,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have received your letter which it is impossible for me not to
                    think a very harsh one.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You have undoubtedly the full right of an author over your works
                    and the full privilege of a man to judge &amp; act on your judgment: but I                     must also feel as a man and I am accustomed as I feel to express myself. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> If you reflect you will not find that my idea that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> had his share in this                    objection which you have at length stated to my notes could be said to be                     groundless. You had said yourself that every person who had seen either the MS.
                    or the proofs had objected to the notes. Was I to suppose, could I suppose,                     consistently with fact and your own letters, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> had not seen either.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I never call on anyone, nor did I on you, for a disclosure of                     names that I have not a right to ask. And you must think I could not be ignorant
                    who had seen the proofs nearly to a man: since nearly all who were likely to
                    have seen them were, I imagine, those whom I introduced to you and whose names I
                    cannot want to ask.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I did say that it was very proper you should write the preface. I
                    had written one: and that was enough. More than sufficient fault was thought
                    necessary to be found with a considerable part of that preface. I was there
                    supposed to have said more than was proper and to have anticipated on the
                    judgment of the public. Perhaps I know what is called the public better than you
                    as yet know it. I know that public is just to authors after their deaths but is
                    commonly too careless to be just to them in their life unless its attention be
                    called to a new author.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> My appendix too was blamed; it was said to be too long. My
                    remarks on my removal as a Justice were treated I must say neither with delicacy
                    nor I think with good judgment.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> I was justly
                    sick of all this. And it required nothing less than the intrepid zeal of a very
                    sincere friendship to write anything for a future edition after such unpleasant
                    reception of what I had written. Reception not from the public not in general
                    from reviewers who have appeared well contented but from the author and from
                    some of the author's acquaintance: not more friends to him possibly nor better
                    judging friends than myself.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> It has at length thus happened that my share as editor has
                    reduced itself to the revision of the press (a task which you will better
                    estimate if you ever undertake it); the suggestion of occasional corrections
                    which have been few there having been few wanted and these very short
                    unfortunate notes. Unfortunate in your reception of them and in the light in
                    which you have been led to consider them. Whether otherwise unfortunate,
                    publication will be the best proof. They assuredly will not appear to lead any
                    judgment which does not wish to be led by them: they are not prefixed but
                    subjoined to the poems. The poem to which each is attached will have been read
                    before the note is seen, if at all seen. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Of course, as to the 8vos &amp; quartos you and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> do as you please. You will
                    omit the notes entirely if you like better. I only will do nothing with them but
                    what I have. I will put them into no other form. The fable of the man and his                     three sons travelling over the bridge is a good lesson and my experience
                    confirms it. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The first thing is to do what we think right. If those whom it                    concerns cannot think with us, life is not to be worn out with fruitless
                    experiments and endeavours at new modes to please. Those who can be pleased are                     commonly pleased at first by those who endeavour it with sincerity. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am very glad the Shepherd and his Dog will be in the                         Mirror. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> Though I do not like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a>, I like that publication. I                     have had the pleasure of seeing a sonnet and a charming one by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftSarah" title="Miss Finch">Miss Finch</a>, transplanted from it into                     the Morning Chronicle. <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> Not by me: for I am not             connected with the editor, but by the good taste of the editor, and of some who
                    are. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Market Night and the Shepherd and his Dog Rover would furnish two                     excellent subjects for wood engraving. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I did not say writing notes on your poems deprived me of a
                    pleasure. But I said, or meant to be understood that I wrote them and often                     revised the proofs at times of such anxiety and agitation that there are not
                    many things but that I would willingly have done in those moments. You introduce                    the epithet 'scoundrel' in a manner that astonishes me. You will find a parcel                     for you at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WalkerAdam" title="Mr Walkers">Mr Walkers</a>, containing Mr                     Blacks poem on the Conjunction of Jupiter &amp; Venus with some other                     poetical pieces which I desire you to accept.<a href="#4"> [4]</a><a name="back4"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You say that no doubt I mean your good. I wish my judgment as
                    well as my meaning were somewhat in credit with you. Probably you will be
                    displeased that I should remind you to make the proper entry as author in
                    Stationers' Hall, previously to this publication, and of your transfer of the
                    moiety of your copyright to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a>.
                    I repeat again that without this neither you nor he are protected in the
                    copyright if anyone chooses to interfere.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I remain yours, &amp;c.</p><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="C.

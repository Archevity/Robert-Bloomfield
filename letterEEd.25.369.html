		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> This is glorious weather, and I am as well as I ever shall be   most likely. I have had much thinking on your present undertaking, and probability of success, for you are never out of my mind by day, and seldom by
                    night. How do you get on? I hope you have bought yourself the articles of
                    clothing you mentioned, for you must <em>yield</em> to the whim of
                    the world: very much depends upon <em>appearance</em>, and you will
                    find that it cannot be neglected with impunity in <em>your</em>
                    situation. Do that which will make you feel happy, and <em>satisfied</em> with yourself. Appearance is not every thing, but it has
                    more power than it is worth, and perhaps than it ought. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> has spent a week in
                    London, and returned only on Wednesday night. She went almost solely on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlottes">Charlottes</a> account, who
                    is <em>not</em> yet married, and agrees to <em>delay</em>. This affair has given us very great perplexity indeed.—<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldJames" title="James">James</a> has been out of place, but
                    has now got another.—Little cousin Charlotte has been deliverd of a dead
                    child—My cousin <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="Austins">Austins</a> son
                    Will, is expected here for a 'how de do'—Miss Weston talks of coming shortly—I
                    have sent my play <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Baldwin">Baldwin</a>, and am
                    anxiously waiting his reply—I have written more letters for our 'post
                        Office' <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> and think it will do well considered as a minor concern     in our persuits—I think I should like to put your 'May day' verses for last
                    year, at the end, but this is only a thought.—Jen Cooper is just returnd, he was
                    unwell in London.—Fanny Fitzjohn is going to visit London for the first
                    time.—Miss Humberstone is rather dangerously lame in her heel.—Mr Gay again goes
                    out.—Have you found out that beautiful walk at Canterbury, 'the Dean john.'—? I
                    think you will find very different companions in your present place compared to
                    such as you have left, they are often vulgar, and ignorant, but you must learn
                    to bear with them as I did with the shoemakers, and try to improve in whatever
                    you are practicing, so that you may be able at a future day to command better
                    wages. I hope it will do, for I should rejoice to see you conquer your
                    difficulties, whatever they may be.—We have been reading 'Memoirs of Napoleon at
                    St Helena', by Count Count [sic] Les Cassas and find the work extremely full of
                        interest. <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> The
                    author was an emigrant in London, and there publish'd under the name Mr 'Le
                    Sage', the very historical maps and 'charts of History' <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> which we have.    Pray read the work if it comes your way and whatever you find in your new
                    attempt don't fail to tell me, both the black and the white side.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I must close here, with wishing to hear from you <em>very soon</em>, for I am figetty about you, and have so much besides to
                    worry me that I want news <em>now</em>.</p>

                        Bloomfield</a>, 27 December 1816<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>. Dec 27. 1816</p><p class="pnonident">My Dear Girl</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> When your parcel came to hand we had just devourd a couple of
                    fine Fowles sent us from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#StanfordBury" title="Stanford Bury">Stanford
                        Bury</a>, and I rejoiced to hear of your health and peace, and the same of
                    your friends.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> As you want news I will now transcribe from a slate where I have
                    kept memorandums, such occurrences as this poor L—y dead place affords.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Mr Long the shopkeeper has faild long ago, his stock and goods
                    sold, himself, I believe, in London, his family dispersed. You know that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr Weston's">Mr Weston's</a> Estate was knockd down
                    to Mr Impey who prov'd incapable of holding it; consequently it has been
                    transfer'd to his Wife's Brother, a Mr Demer of Hitchin, a boasting hollow lump
                    of worldly cunning. This is my landlord. At the time our repairs were going on
                    Mr Impey left his former house in the street by Taylor's and came next door to
                    us, which place was vacant by the removal of Wells, this indeed on the part of
                    Wells was rather worse than a removal, for his <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">real</em> wife
                    came here from Brighton and stird him up, till he sold all his goods to Impey
                    and I believe decamp'd for a while but they are still here in town. Having Impey
                    close by us we were for some weeks rejoiced by the sounds of Old Coppers and
                    Sauspans and became sure of a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">comfortable</em> situation, when
                    all at once Mr Impey became insolvent, and about three weeks ago his sale
                    comprehended his stock and goods! He now makes a workshop of Brigg's thatch'd
                    shed where the tailors used to work.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I learn that Mr Ibbs of this town has taken Mr Palmers Farm at
                    Rowney—Nightengall has given up his Farm to a Mr Inskip.—Polehanger is in the
                    occupation of a Mr Kirk, or Kirkby—Tom Hoffer and young Steven have had a short
                    lodgement at Bedford Jail for a row with Mr Layman at the Bonfire—I am sorry to
                    say that the Frocks you sent for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> are too short
                    for the great <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">morther</em>: as she has grown an inch and half
                    since last April, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> is an inch and half taller than she. They will yet come into
                    use and I thank you for your thoughtfulness and affection in sending them. I am
                    sorry to inform you that we have had a great deal of Fever around us lately, but
                    not very fatal, though of the Typhus kind I believe. Mr Gay's children were
                    nearly all bad with it, and a young woman formerly their servant, but now
                    married and living at Brigg's caught it being their nurse. They are all out of
                    danger.—Our old washwoman Saunders and three children have gone through this
                    visitation successfully, and being so near us we have used some caution.— Last
                    week the other washer Mother Seeny, or Maddie, or Hoffman, or what not, had the
                    misfortune to burn to a cinder <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="your mothers">your
                        mothers</a> best Gown, together with the chair on which it was left <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">just for a minute</em> of course; a few minutes more would have
                    burnt all the goods she has and perhaps the primises! We had lately a harmless
                    Flood, so that if you put together <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flood, Fire, Fever</em> and
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bankruptcy</em> you will have at least some of the plagues
                    of life.—I hear of no <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Widdings</em> and therefore must proceed
                    to other subjects.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The Subscription—aye, the subscription, goes on very much like a
                    Donkey in a dirty lane with his legs tired—From <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharp">Miss Sharp</a> I only hear of

                    Cornwall, nor no reply from the Lord Mayor—There is a Miss Cropley of Euston Stt

                    younger that there is now due to me a small and final Dividend of 9d in the
                    pound! These jolly old Ninepences will amount to about £14.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#OsborneGeorge" title="Sir George">Sir George</a> has just sent Mr Coats

                    of Port.—The post hour creeps on—I agree almost entirely with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr Weston">Mr Weston</a> as to the Examiner; if
                    they do not take care it will die like our old Mirror, expiring in a [word cut

                    in due time by writing take down the hump on his back as easily as I would take
                    off my night-cap.—I see no Reviews, no papers, but <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hunt</em> and

                    no Rhumatism////This moment Mrs Flint calld to say that she will send a parcel
                    to Twickenham on Monday or Tuesday—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Best love to Mr &amp; Miss <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Weston">Weston</a> now and for ever</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You want none of my love of course, and so I only

					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> 'A kind of enchantment took possession of my mind and sences too
                    on Friday evening, from eight till twelve O'clock. The hot breezes of a summer's
                    day were gone to rest; and a Water expanded itself before me that seem'd to have
                    no motion but the swelling of a slow rising tide; the western clouds lay still;
                    and Echo was ready to answer every word and every breath. I floated on its
                    surface allmost before I was aware, and saw the busy world dusty, and fateagued
                    travelling in two distinct tracks over my head. The oblique shadows pointed at
                    me from the shore; gladness was the ruler of all present, and was obey'd. At
                    last landing, I left the pleasant waters to go on, to catch new shadows and wash
                    other shores, and had scarcely felt my feet before a Fairy Vision extended
                    itself that defied the eye of indifference. The Magic power that had caused and
                    seem'd to govern the whole scene had hung ten thousand lighted sparks twinkling
                    like stars around the boughs of trees, so that the under side of the foliage
                    became illuminated and gave to the eye an ashcolour'd green; every leaf as still
                    as the trunk on which it grew, for not a breath of air passd over them. On the
                    illuminated sand below appear'd a mixd society of creatures, apparently mortal
                    who either actually were happy or had left for a time the appearance of
                    unhappiness behind them. A great proportion of those wore a female garb, but, as
                    they were not fateagued with labour or exposed to the sun I could not discover
                    why it was that their necks and shoulders were bare. I was meditating on these
                    things when a fresh and sudden kind of enchantment set the whole assembly in
                    motion, for who moves not at the sound of musick? As the bodies of trees growing
                    near to the eye sometimes intercept and cut parts of a distant landscape, so did
                    they here, as it were, cut the vibrations of the musick traveling from the
                    centre of the scene to its confines. Somtimes it was sweetly melancholy, and a
                    voice made the shades ring with,</p><p class="indent4"> Faithless Edward is not here</p><p class="pnonident">Then at intervals in a remote part of the enchanted grove, a delightfull thrill
                    came through the bosom from the roll of the fife and the "spirit stirring Drum".
                    The fantastick bounces of the Tamborine invited the heart to mirth and every
                    note going to the boundary of the grove, seem'd to return in search of others
                    but that instant struck from the instrument or voice. Smiles of hilarity were on
                    every countenance, and particularly on those of the Fairies who with a waving
                    plume and bosoms heaving to the sounds they gave, stood and pour'd forth spirit
                    of song. Six voices caught from each other the words</p><div xmlns="" class="lg"><div class="indent4"> Lads and lasses lets be gay</div><div class="indent4"> For this is Nature's holyday<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#2"> [2]</a><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="back2"> </a></div></div><br xmlns=""/><p class="pnonident">I also observed that round the whole scene were distributed a great variety of
                    tables set with the choicest and most tempting refreshments; such they apeard to
                    be; but whither on being touch'd as in some other enchanted woods and castles
                    they would have vanished from before me I cannot tell as I did not put it to the
                    trial. I could not help admiring much as assemblage of younger Fairies who,
                    cloathed in white, and full of mirth, danced to the Tamborine, and ran in
                    parties from the illuminated to darker shades, from tree to tree, and seemd as
                    ignorant of what we mortals call care and pain, as if they had never heard of
                    them.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Musick and Beauty are powerfull allurements. If the mere scene
                    had been shewn without them, I should have prefer'd the view of the evening sky
                    on the water, to the Fairies lamps, their grassless groves, and their publick
                    tables. And Fairy Visions in my estimation must still yield to a green grass
                    bank; the soul-chearing balm of the morning air; leaves brightened by <em>Natures</em> Luminary; and violets peeping through the long
                    grass as if to see how high he has mounted. Nor are those cheap, those common
                    scenes without the charm of Musick. When I heard the uncage'd Blackbird and the
                    Nightingale last May, and tried to bear in mind the amazing variations of the
                    latter bird, tried to draw near the twig, that supported him, and saw the little
                    feathers on his throat fall smooth at every pause, I felt Musick's most
                    bewitching power. If ungovernable sighs rise at such a moment who would try to
                    check them? If gratefull reflection joins the ear and the eye's feast and should
                    produce a tear, an empassion'd stamp of the foot; or, an exulting skip upon a
                    molehill, that tear, and that triumph is the triumph of Nature. — '</p>

                        Grafton's</a> compliments to Mr. Bloomfield, &amp; is glad to have
                    been reminded by him of the arrear of the annual allowance, which he has by this
                    post, directed Messrs. Drummonds, in Charing Cross, to pay, in full, to Mr
                    Bloomfield when he calls for it, or authorises anyone to receive it for him, to
                    the amount of thirty pounds, being up to next March.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonGeorgeHenry4" title="Duke of Grafton">Duke of
                        Grafton</a> regrets that Mr. B.s' muse should have been so long silent; an
                    occurrence such as was witnessed by several persons in a neighbouring forest
                    (Salsey), might have roused her from her lethargy, if she had been within reach
                    of surveying the remains of the largest oak in the forest, which fell with a
                    prodigious crash, a few days ago, within a hundred yards of the principal lodge,
                    of which it had been for an age the chief ornament; the noise attracted the
                    notice of all, but of none more than the forest deer, which assembled &amp;
                    remained for some hours around it, as if to perform the funeral obsequies of a
                    departed &amp; reverend friend; at last, they seemed mournfully to retire,
                    their movements being silent and slow.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> If Mr. B., when he was on a visit at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Wakefield" title="Wakefield Lodge">Wakefield Lodge</a>, rode over, as I think
                    he did, to Salsey Forest, he will have had pointed out to him a particular Oak,
                    which is supposed to be the largest in circumference, as well as the oldest in
                    the forest; but in point of height, character, &amp; magnificence, it is not
                    to be compared to the Oak to which the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonGeorgeHenry4" title="D. of G.">D. of G.</a> alluded, as having,
                    by its fall, occasioned such a sensation among the wild as well as civilized
                    inhabitants of the forest.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonGeorgeHenry4" title="D. of G.">D. of G.</a>
                    will be very glad to hear of Mr Bloomfield being well, &amp; that he has
                    received the sum directed to be paid to him.</p><p class="l">near Stony Stratford </p>Feb'y 10: 1817</div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>Copy, enclosed

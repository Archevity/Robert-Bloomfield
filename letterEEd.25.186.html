                    in a packet from cousin Isaac to his friends.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You say that you and I did not think <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">just</em>
                    alike as to the preface, very likely not. But we thought alike on the subject of
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr L's">Mr L's</a> eternal additions, and you
                    knew <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">then</em> and was witness in some degree to the dislike of
                    the readers to certain parts of the preface. Of this you and I talked much
                    during the short intercourse we had at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> and at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a>. I
                    had <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">assured you</em>, as one who would hear it though <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr L">Mr L</a><em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> would not</em>, that in <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">all companies</em>
                    wherein the subject had been mentioned, the sentiment was the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">same</em>, invariably the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">same</em>. I have never <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">seen</em> nor <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">heard</em> the man or woman who,
                    speaking of the subject did not applaud his zeal for me, and at the same time
                    either condemn with anger, or ridicule his want of judgment, his arrogance, or
                    his vanity; just which they happen'd to hit upon, as in their opinion the most
                    applicable. I have several letters by me from unknown hands abusing him for
                    going too far, in particular for his notes at the foot of the page in the Rural
                    Tales, his 'simply pleasing' was to my knowledge a bye word among the young
                    ladies at a boarding school. What ideas they attached to it to make them giggle
                    may easily be divined. I know two high authorities in the Literary world, one of
                    them cut out the notes with his pen knife, and the other would not suffer the
                    copy to enter his library, but destroy'd it when he could procure one that had
                    them not. The former is a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">friend</em> of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="CL">CL</a>, and lives at Stamford, and was the
                    man who wrote the Review of my Wild Flowers in the Mirror.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> I have had conversations with at
                    least a dozen Gentlemen in different lines of connection at Edenborough who
                    describe the same sentiments strongly expressed there, and as universally as in
                    England. Archer the Great Bookseller at Dublin told me the very same tale of the
                    Literati of the Sister Country, and Stansbury, late a Bookseller at New York
                    gave (voluntarily) the same evidence exactly respecting the people of America,
                    and in the editions of the Rural Tales printed there the notes were left out. I
                    have seen a Gentleman lately from the North of Germany (now in your town) who
                    mentioned to me with peculiar disgust the same hacknied worn out subject. They
                    all cry 'why dont you tell the man he is doing too much?' or something to that
                    effect. Now <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a> what does
                    the little man say to me when I would broach this. Why he says, truly, that I
                    have nothing to do with it! here he is egregiously wrong. Does he forget that I
                    have constantly to hear him ridiculed and abus'd and is this nothing? I do not
                    pretend to assert that two years ago you knew just as well as I did how strong
                    the outcry was against him, but this I assert, that you know a great <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">deal indeed</em> of it, and therefore when your Note* stated to
                    him that the opposers of him and his tyranny were only a few of the 'hangers on'
                    of that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Bookseller">Bookseller</a> with whom you <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">knew</em> he had an inveterate
                    quarrel you did, (I hope) more mischief than you intended. that man would listen
                    to Tom Cat if he could flatter him, so dont pretend that you are too obscure and
                    too humble to be able to do mischief. (whether intended or not.) Were I to take
                    it as a risible subject, there is abundance of room for can anyone conceive a
                    poor fellow more universally loaded with hangers on! There is something in that
                    same letter of yours respecting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WindhamWilliam" title="Windham">Windham</a>, which from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nats">Nats</a> and my own sentiments differ so horribly that I think I shall
                    one day send it you with a few notes, that you may see if I have understood it
                    right or wrong'd you when I deem'd you a turntail and a shufler, and that at <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a pinch</em>, you would swallow professions by pailfulls and
                    glory in the unhappiness you had wrought. Whatever blame you might have heap'd
                    upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Hood">Hood</a> at that time (or this)
                    would be sure to be wellcome at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Troston" title="Troston">Troston</a>.
                    You will perceive by the tone of this letter that it will be well to send it me
                    again. I am only speaking in it to <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">you</em>, and send the

		<br/><div class="letter"><h3>413. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George Bloomfield">George Bloomfield</a> to  William Hone, 5 December 1827 <a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3>
		<p align="right">2, High Baxter Street, Bury St Edmond's,  </p>
		<p align="right">Dec. 5th, 1827.</p>
		<p class="pnonident">Sir,</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> A gentleman desires me to write to you, as editor of the             <cite>Table Book</cite>, it being his wish that a view which he sent of        the little cottage at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a> should   appear in that very curious work <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> The birth-place of    Robert Bloomfield I think may excite the interest of some of your readers; but,   sir, if they find out that you correspond with a superannuated <em>cold water poet</em>,<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> your work will smell of poverty.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Lord Byron took pains to flog two of my brothers, as poachers on                    the preserves of the qualified proprietors of literature.<a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> It is thought, if he had  not been wroth with the Edinburgh Reviewers, these poor poachers might have
                    escaped; they, like me, had neither birth nor education to entitle them to a
                    qualification.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> If, sir, you ever saw an old wall blown down, or, as we have it    here in the country, if the wall '<em>fall of its own accord</em>,'   you may have observed that the first thing the workmen do, is to pick out the   whole bricks into one heap, the bats into another, and the rubbish into a third.    Thus, sir, if in what falls from me to you,<a href="#4"> [4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> you can     find any whole bricks, or even bats, that may be placed in your work, pick them    out; but I much fear all will be but rubbish unfit for your purpose.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> So much has been said, in the book published by my brothers, of
                    'the little tailor's four little sons,' who once resided in the old cottage,   that I cannot add much that is new, and perhaps the little I have to relate will   be uninteresting. But I think the great and truly good man, the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="late duke of Grafton">late duke of Grafton</a>, ought    to have been more particularly mentioned. Surely, after near thirty years, the      good sense and benevolence of that real <em>noble</em>man may be    mentioned. When in my boyhood, he held the highest office in the state that a     subject can fill, and like all that attain such preeminence, had his enemies;      yet the more Junius<a href="#5"> [5]</a><a name="back5"> </a> and others railed at him,    the more I revered him. He was our 'Lord of the Manor,' and as I knew well his    private character, I had no doubt but he was 'all of a piece.' I have on foot
                    joined the foxchase, and followed <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="the duke">the duke</a> many an hour, and    witnessed his endearing condescension to all who could run and shout. When   Robert became known as the <em>Farmer's Boy</em>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="the duke">the duke</a> earnestly  cautioned him on no account to change his habits of living, but at the same time encouraged him in his habits of <em>reading</em>, and kindly gave him a gratuity of a shilling a day, to enable him to employ more time in reading than heretofore. This gratuity was always paid while <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="the duke">the duke</a> lived, and was  continued by the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonGeorgeHenry4" title="present duke">present     duke</a> till Robert's death.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Could poor Robert have kept his children in their old habits of  <em>living</em>, he might have reserved some of the profits    arising from his works, but he loved his children too tenderly to be a niggard;  and, besides, he received his profits at a time when bread was six or seven   shillings per stone: no wonder that with a sickly family to sup port, he was    embarrassed.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="The duke">The duke</a> likewise strongly   advised him not to write <em>too much</em>, but keep the ground he  had gained, &amp;c. As hereditary sealer of the writs in the Court of King's
                    Bench, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="the duke">the duke</a> gave
                    Robert the situation of under sealer, but his health grew so bad he was obliged    to give it up; he held it several months, however, and doubtless many a poor    fellow went to coop under Robert's seal. It was peculiarly unfortunate be could    not keep his place, for I think <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenWilliam" title="Mr Allen">Mr   Allen</a>, the master-sealer, did not live above two years, and it is more   than probable <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="the duke">the duke</a>   would have made Robert master-sealer, and then he would have had sufficient
                    income. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="The duke's">The duke's</a>
                    condescension and kindness to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my mother">my    mother</a> was very great, he learned her real character, and called on   her at her own cottage, and freely talked of gone-by times, (her father was an    old tenant to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="the duke">the duke</a>.)  He delicately left a half guinea at Mr. Roper's, a gentleman farmer, to be given   to her after his departure, and when he heard of her death he ordered a handsome   gravestone to be placed over her, at his expense, and requested the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FellowesRobert" title="Rev. Mr. Fellowes">Rev. Mr. Fellowes</a> to write an  inscription. It is thus engraven:—</p>
					<p align="center">BENEATH THIS STONE</p>
					<p align="center">Are deposited the mortal remains of</p><p align="center"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="ELIZABETH GLOVER">ELIZABETH GLOVER</a>
                    who died Dec. 27th, 1803.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Her maiden name was MANBY, and she was twice married. By her
                    first husband, who lies buried near this spot, she was mother of six children;  the youngest of whom was ROBERT BLOOMFIELD, the pastoral Poet. In her household   affairs she was a pattern of cleanliness, industry, and good management. By her   kind, her meek, her inoffensive behaviour, she had conciliated the sincere good   will of all her neighbours and acquaintance; nor amid the busy cares of time was    she ever forgetful of Eternity. But her religion was no hypocritical service, no vain form of words; it consisted in loving God and keeping his commandments, as  they have been made known to us by JESUS CHRIST.</p><p align="center"><em>Reader, go thou and do likewise</em>.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> If ever I was proud of any thing it was of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my mother">my mother</a>, nor do I think, strong     as is the praise in the above, it is overdone. For solid strength of intellect   she surpassed all her sons, and had more real practical virtues than all of them   put together. Kind Providence spared her to bless me till I was far on the wrong    side of fifty.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I must say a word or two on her sons, because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Capel Loftt">Capel Loftt</a>, Esq., in his preface to     my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a>'s poems, has said    <em>too much</em> about them, <em>viz</em>. 'Beyond   question, the brothers of this family are all <em>extraordinary</em>      men.' Now, sir, as I am the oldest of these brothers, I will tell first of
                    myself. I wrote a little poem, when near seventy, on the <a  href="..\BloomfieldPages\NatGeoTexts\thetford.html" title="Thetford Chalybeate Spa" target="_blank">Thetford Chalybeate Spa</a>'Thetford Spa'</a>; but dreading those    snarling curs, the <em>critics</em>, forebore to affix my name to   it. Mr. Smith, of Cambridge, printed it gratuitously; but as soon as it was  discovered I was the author, my acquaintance styled me the <em>cold water poet</em>. I think my title will do very well. Brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nathaniel">Nathaniel</a> wrote some poems;<a href="#6"> [6]</a><a name="back6"> </a> unluckily they were printed
                    and published here at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a>, and
                    the pack of critics hunted down the book. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> has had thirteen children, and   most of them are living, and so is he. Brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> was a machinist.
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BoysJohn" title="John Boys">John Boys</a>, Esq. gave him in all  twenty pounds, but he died a young man, and left his self-working pumps  unfinished. Eight of his children are living. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The old cottage sold to Robert had been in the family near  fourscore years. It proved a hard bargain to Robert; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my mother">my mother</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> occupied the    cottage, and could not pay rent; and after the death of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my mother">my mother</a>, poor Robert was in
                    distress and sold it:—the lawyers would not settle the business, and Robert died
                    broken-hearted, and never received sixpence!</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The lawyers constantly endeavour to make work for the trade. I
                    believe it to be true, as some say, that we are now as much <em>law</em>-ridden as we were <em>priest</em>-ridden some ages ago. I like Charlotte Smith's definition of the Law Trade. Orlando, in the 'Old
                    Manor House,' says to Carr, the lawyer, 'I am afraid you are all rogues  together;' Carr replies, 'More or less, my good friend;—some have more sense   than others, and some a little more conscience—but for the rest, I am afraid we  are all of us a little too much <em>professional</em> rogues: though  some of us, as individuals, would not starve the orphan, or break the heart of    the widow, yet, in our vocation, we give all remorse of that sort to the    winds.'<a href="#7"> [7]</a><a name="back7"> </a> My last account from     Robert's family says, the lawyers have not yet <em>settled</em> the    poor old cottage!</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> and I only survive of the little tailor's 'extraordinary' children—quite past our labour, and destitute of   many comforts we used to enjoy in youth. We have but one step farther to fall,  (i.e.) into the workhouse! Yet in the nature of things it cannot be long ere   death will close the scene. We have had our day, and night must come. I hope we  shall welcome it as heartily as Sancho in Don Quixote did sleep, 'Blessed be he who first invented sleep, it covers a man all over like a cloak.'<a href="#8"> [8]</a><a name="back8"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I shall indeed be agreeably disappointed if any one     should bestow any thing upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a>, or</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Sir, your humble obedient servant. </p>

In a paragraph prefatory to the     letter text, Hone stated: 'The MSS. from whence the present selections have     been hastily made, were accompanied by a letter from George Bloomfield,    written nearly a month ago. They were delayed by the person who transmitted the parcel till the opportunity of noticing them in this work had almost  passed. All that could be done in an hour or two is before the reader; and   no more has been aimed at than what appears requisite to awaken sympathy and    crave assistance towards an aged and indigent brother of the author of the  <cite>Farmer's Boy</cite>.

Aunt George
                    applied for what I could not for the soul of me procure untill yesterday I
                    therefore growld, and sighd, and smoked, and slepd, and growld again, and
                    ultimately could not send untill mondays Coach. I now write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> and hope that he will have it
                    on the Tuesday, but if you leave the village to be at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> the following day, it may
                    happen that he may not have recieved it when you go, though this is rather
                    unlikely. I have said that you will certainly call, and I think there is little
                    cause for perturbation of spirit. I advise you to give your name at the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">front</em> door, and request to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a>. If he should be out, ask if
                    the ladies are within and repeat the same request.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I enclose a letter for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="Mr Austin">Mr Austin</a> according to your
                    wish, and am indeed glad to find you so full of spirits and health, yet you dont
                    know how much I want to see you. Thetford is a queer old place and you will get
                    a good notion of it by your visits, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldKitty" title="Aunt Kate">Aunt Kate</a> is a queer old touch, but with much <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">decision</em> of character as I call it. If you can see the Theatre at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> do so by all means, write to
                    me the day you get there, and again to state the evening of your return. If you
                    have not told Mary Binley the time of your return I wish particularly to keep
                    the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">particular</em> hour from her father, otherwise he will be
                    here, or accompany me to the Inn to meet you. Last <del>Thursday</del> Wednesday <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="your Mother">your                         Mother</a> went and slepd at Deptford, and I walk'd there the next morning                     and got [word deleted] Nothing.—I shall dine with him on that day fortnight, and                     hope for better luck. I have just cut the gourds, they would not hang till you                     came home. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Honour" title="Honour">Honour</a> has been with a how di                     do, and her dad is just gone home.

                    will only be mortified. Keep humble and squint at them all as you know how. I
                    will meet you and your luggage at the Inn.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have several times intended to remind you that If your Cousins
                    at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a> or any other boys have
                    any 'Fairies Cakes,' curiously markd pebbles and will part with them for
                    halfpence, bring what you can, They will know what you mean. Bring away some
                    thunderbolts, and some 'Devel's Toe Nails', which are found in a field north of
                    what was Mr Rolfs Rookery, but if these are not to be had, dont stop for either.
                    These strange names make it look like a queer errand to set a young girl about,
                    but I tell you they know what I mean—I feel proud of your letters, but I would
                    rather have your company. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary">Mary</a> is growing fast, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="Rob">Rob</a> is asleep, the other two cracking walnuts, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="mother">mother</a> well.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The time prevents my saying more now.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> And I am once more your Affectionate Father</p><p align="right">Rob Bloomfield</p><p class="pnonident">thank you for the Nutts</p><p class="pnonident">I am happily busy on the Banks of Wye</p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add.

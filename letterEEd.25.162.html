                    when I wrote last, so much so that I resolved to accept <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DisneyJohn" title="Dr Disney's">Dr Disney's</a> invitation for a day or
                    two. I meant to go to Ingatestone (23 miles) on Wednesday last, but having by
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Mr Youngs">Mr Youngs</a> advice taken phisick,
                    I was forced to stop till Thursday morning; I was home again on Saturday night,
                    not being willing to leave the house long to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Honour" title="Honour">Honour</a>, though she grows more capable every day, and because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary">Mary</a> was far from well,
                    and not quite happy. her spirits are mended with her health, and she is going on
                    very well. I met a very kind reception at the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DisneyJohn" title="Doctor's">Doctor's</a>. They have a noble mansion,
                    and fine estate. they regretted much that I could not stop with them, and so did
                    I, as I found my appetite mended by my short visit, I had some delightfull
                    walks, and brought home a present of valuable pictures. I have taking [sic]
                    pills to day, and have no doubt of being well in a day or two. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have not been able to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Young">Young</a> this morning, but if he thinks you are not dealing right with
                    the knee I will write again tomorrow or Wednesday. I am surprised at your
                    firmness in resolving to keep it open, but think that whatever be the end of it
                    we shall both at last think that we have done our utmost duty by him, and rest
                    contented with our lot.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> As to Mr Morah, you should not be unhappy about him, you know
                    Doctors love to hear the clink of a Guinea; there is nothing strange in his
                    apparent neglect, perhaps he only think you have no money in your pocket, which
                    would cool the zeal of the first Doctors in England. Hereafter, if you can
                    reside at Worthing with pleasure during the summer, if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Dr Youngs">Dr Youngs</a> method fails, and you still
                    want to try Morah, there is no doubt but he will act as soon as you go to him
                    with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="the child">the child</a> and offer
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">to pay him</em>. Think, therefore, no more about that until
                    you want him. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary">Mary</a> was
                    only very ill several days with the head ache, nobody cross'd her she says.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I mean to write to Sister <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HingstonElizabeth" title="Bet">Bet</a> tomorrow.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The engravers are coming home from Suffolk tomorrow or next day
                    with their sketches and they will call on me<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I wish much that you may make some comfortable acquaintance at
                    Worthing, as that will make you relish the banished situation you are forced to
                    be in, and therefore I am glad you visit Mr Philips. And I have no doubt that in
                    July you will have in your town many families who have a knowledge of me, and
                    who will show you respect for both our sakes. Do your utmost with the poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a>, as I know you will,
                    and at the same time do not forget that your own health and recovery depends
                    much, or perhaps entirely on your state of mind, try to be happy.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> When Mrs Belton urges 5s. a week more rent, give it without a
                    scruple, or you may repent it, for you know not how many there will be visiting
                    the town in the next month. nevertheless, when she advances, try to bargain for
                    another month at that price, and so on if you stay. The country about you must
                    be delightfull if you can but get out, or perhaps on the Sands in your favourite
                    walk, but how can you get <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="charles">charles</a> along if you give up the Chaise? But you must know most about
                    that. I very much long to see you all, but that is so natural a thing that we
                    all feel, that it is hardly worth writing about, the time will come when we
                    shall meet again Untill then, God bless you all. Give <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> a kiss for me. Love
                    to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a>. Remember to send
                    weekly. Yours ever Dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary">Mary</a> most truly </p><p align="right">Rob Bloomfield</p><p class="pnonident">I hope you got the parcel with the Book and Money? You should have

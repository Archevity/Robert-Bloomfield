                        John Lloyd Baker</a>, 4 October 1814<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>. Beds. Oct 4. 1814</p><p class="pnonident">To T. L. Baker Esq.</p><p class="pnonident">Dear Sir,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Some Genius, whether good or evil I cannot discover, has
                    contrived that you are not to find me at home when you honour me with a call. I
                    am realy vexd, and cannot hit on a better method of mitigating that vexation
                    than by stating, as far as a letter will go, what I have been about, and in what
                    state I find myself now.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I think you have heard of the Bankruptcy of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrosbyBenjamin" title="my Bookseller">my Bookseller</a>, but you cannot be
                    supposed to enter with me into all the troubles consequent thereon.—I have
                    buried a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Daughter">Daughter</a> who
                    possessd all that I could wish in sense and affection. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="My wife">My wife</a> is a staunch diciple of
                    Johanna Southcott,<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> my four Children at home. The
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="eldest Boy">eldest Boy</a>, formerly
                    lame, is growing and healthy, and is making a rapid progress in Arithmatic.—My
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="youngest Boy">youngest Boy</a> is Seven
                    and a half, and likewise goes to school. My <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Eldest Girl">Eldest Girl</a> is a woman in years,
                    and I hope, in all that may continue her my friend. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Youngest Girl">Youngest Girl</a> is
                    thirteen, and is growing very fast.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> If you calculate dates you will find that last March the Farmers
                    Boy had been publishd fourteen years; and consequently the Bookseller's half of
                    the Copyright reverted to me, and I spent some anxious weeks in London
                    endeavouring to procure from them a Sum for the continuation of their share for
                    fourteen years to come. I obtaind about half the sum which I suppose their
                    chance is worth.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> After this, being much out of health, I went with a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="friend and neighbour">friend and neighbour</a> to the Coast
                    for a few days; saw the Landing of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AlexanderTsar" title="Alexander">Alexander</a> at Dover, and came home with an increase of strength and
                    exhilaration. I was not long at home before my Suffolk affairs demanded my
                    attention and presence. A month has past since I joind with the Farmers and old
                    friends in my Native Vale, and while there I heard that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Mr Baker">Mr Baker</a> had <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">again calld</em>, and found me rambling. The world has gone but moderately
                    with me for three years past. I have a thousand times thought of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Uley" title="Uley">Uley</a> vally, and of you and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert" title="Mr Cooper">Mr Cooper</a>, but always with somthing
                    very like dispair of ever seeing you again.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Since I have had this sheet in hand, Mrs Walker of this Town has
                    brought me news, it is not political I assure you, but it concerns me in some
                    measure, as one of your wellwishers, and if I dare make so free I would say 'And
                    so I find Queen <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mab</em> has been with you.'? but as I know too
                    little of Shakespear, and but little of the Lady, I can only wish you joy in the
                    common way, and declare that I am in earnest in my wish<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You would probably, if you saw me, enquire if my mind was still
                    running on new subjects for the Muse? I can give you little satisfaction on that
                    subject, but I somtimes dream that I shall one day venture again before the
                    public somthing in my old manner, some country tales, and spiced with love and
                    courtship might yet please, for Rural life by the art of Cooking may be made a
                    relishing and high flavourd dish, whaever it may be in reality.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Pray give my best respects to the Seniors of your family, to the
                    Lady of your choice, and the Children, and if you still live near the good folks
                    of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#FerneyHill" title="Ferney Hill">Ferney Hill</a>, say that I am amongst
                    the living but sadly remiss in my tasks, for tasks they are, to write long
                    letters. Tell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperCharlotte" title="Miss C Cooper">Miss C Cooper</a>,
                    that instead of gliding down the Wye in the character of a Fairy, Time has
                    contrive'd that I should wear a Wig and write with Spectacles. With these double
                    eyes, and a heart that cannot loose its old impressions I Remain Dear Sir. Most

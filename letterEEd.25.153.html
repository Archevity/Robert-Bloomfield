                    was buried last night.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> We have had a sad time of it, and great expence. She was ill just a fortnight, and died on the 27<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of December between 5 and 6 in the evening. She was never left nor neglected by night or by day; the Doctor attended
                    dayly, but her attack was too violent to admit of remedy. I was present at her death, a most afflicting scene! </p><p class="pnonident"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldKitty" title="Kitty">Kitty</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverJohn" title="my Father">my Father</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldElizabeth1789" title="Bet">Bet</a>, myself, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> and his children, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="Mr Austin">Mr

                    have erected on the grave, and says that with our permission he will get it done as a token of respect, by subscription amongst
                    the neighbouring Gentry, that the expence may not fall on me.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> This plan of his render'd it necessary to have the grave arch'd and brick'd to the top, which
                    with much exertion we accomplished just in time to recieve the Coffin. This have increas'd the expence, but I know that you will
                    not begrudge what I have done when I come to show you why and how I have spent my money. It is a very great satisfaction to me
                    that I was here. I have had £20 transmitted to me from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a>. I am now going to see

If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> comes <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> will see her to the
                    Coach and give her instructions as to breakfast and dinner and her bundle. She might bring colours and drawing utensils, and will

                    torn] ride or her means of geting home again don't let her come, for, I want to be home next week; and shall very likely leave her
                    behind. Weigh the job well and if it appears wrong, say so by writing to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a>
                    directly; or if she comes be sure write to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> the day before. I want 4 of the
                    portraits. I wish <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> could pack them either by rolling them without creasing and
                    putting them in a tin tube like a candle Box, or in a narrow deal box by the Coach.<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> I know has some reason
                    about her and if you all think the present proposal wrong which I rather doubt myself even while I write, they may both depend on
                    coming here or elsewhere in finer weather.

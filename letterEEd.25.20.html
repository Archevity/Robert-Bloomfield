		<p style="text-indent:40px;">As I spent five years with the Author, from the time he was   thirteen years and a half old till he was turned of eighteen, the most   interesting time of life (I mean the time that instruction is acquired, if    acquired at all), I think I am able to give a Better account of him than any one    can, or than he can of himself: for his Modesty would not let him speak of his
                    Temper, Disposition, or Morals.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Robert was the younger Child of George Bloomfield, a Taylor, at    <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a>. His Father died when he     was an infant under a year old. His <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother">Mother</a> was a Schoolmistress, and instructed her own Children with the  others. He thus learned to read as soon as he learned to speak.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Though the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother">Mother</a>   was left a Widow with six small Children, yet with the help of Friends she
                    managed to give each of them a little schooling.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Robert was accordingly sent to Mr. Rodwell,<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#IxworthThorpe" title="Ixworth">Ixworth</a>, to be improved in Writing:     but he did not go to that School more than two or three months, nor was ever     sent to any other; his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother">Mother</a>   again marrying when Robert was about seven years old.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> By her second husband, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverJohn" title="John Glover">John     Glover</a>, she had another family.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> When Robert was not above eleven years old, the late <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamUncle" title="Mr. W. Austin">Mr. W. Austin</a>, of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Sapiston" title="Sapiston">Sapiston</a>, took him. And though it is      customary for Farmers to pay such Boys only 1s. 6d. per week, yet he generously  took him into the house. This relieved his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother">Mother</a> of any other expence than  only of finding him a few things to wear: and this was more than she well knew    how to do.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> She wrote, therefore to me and my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> (then in London), to assist    her; mentioning that he, Robert, was so small of his age that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamUncle" title="Mr. Austin">Mr. Austin</a> said he was not     likely to be able to get his living by hard labour.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> [Mr. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="G. Bloomfield">G.
                        Bloomfield</a> on this informed his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother">Mother</a> that, if she would let him  take the Boy with him, he would take him, and teach him to make shoes: and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> promised to clothe him. The        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother">Mother</a>, upon this offer,
                    took coach and came to London, to Mr. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="G. Bloomfield">G. Bloomfield</a>, with the Boy: for she said, she never should have been
                    happy if she had not put him herself into his hands.]</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> She charged me as I valued a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother's">Mother's</a> Blessing, to watch over
                    him, to set good Examples for him, and never to forget that he had lost his      Father.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> [Mr. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="G. Bloomfield">G.  Bloomfield</a> then lived at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SimmsMr" title="Mr. Simm's">Mr.
                        Simm's</a>, No. 7, Fisher's-court, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BellAlley" title="Bell-alley">Bell-alley</a>, Coleman-street.] It is customary in such houses as are  let to poor people in London, to have light Garrets fit for Mechanics to work  in. In the Garret, where we had two turn-up Beds, and five of us worked, I
                    received little Robert.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> As we were all single Men, Lodgers at a Shilling per week each,
                    our beds were coarse, and all things far from being clean and snug, like what   Robert had left at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Sapiston" title="Sapiston">Sapiston</a>. Robert was
                    our man, to fetch all things to hand. At Noon he fetched our Dinners from the    Cook's Shop: and any one of our fellow workmen that wanted to have any thing  fetched in, would send him, and assist in his work and teach him, for a    recompense for his trouble.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Every day when the Boy from the Public-house came for the pewter
                    pots, and to hear what Porter was wanted, he always brought the yesterday's     Newspaper. The reading of the Paper we had been used to take by turns; but after  Robert came, he mostly read for us,... because his time was of least value.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> He frequently met with words that he was unacquainted with: of    this he often complained. I one day happened at a Book-stall to see a small   Dictionary, which had been very ill used. I bought it for him for 4d. By the      help of this he in little time could read and comprehend the long and beautiful                     speeches of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurkeEdmund" title="Burke">Burke</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames" title="Fox">Fox</a>, or <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NorthFrederick" title="North">North</a>.</p>
					
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> One Sunday, after an whole day's stroll in the country, we by accident went into a dissenting Meeting-house in the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#OldJewry" title="Old Jewry">Old Jewry</a>, where a Gentleman was  lecturing. This Man filled little Robert with astonishment. The House was  amazingly crowded with the most genteel people; and though we were forced to  stand still in the Aisle, and were much pressed, yet Robert always quickened his  steps to get into the Town on a Sunday evening soon enough to attend this
                    Lecture.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The Preacher lived somewhere at the West End of the Town... his   name was <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FawcettJoseph" title="Fawcet">Fawcet</a>. His language was   just such as the Rambler <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> is written in; his  Action like a person acting a Tragedy; his Discourse rational, and free from the    Cant of Methodism.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Of him Robert learned to accent what he called <em>hard</em> words; and otherwise improved himself; and gained the most   enlarged notions of Providence.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> He went sometimes with me to a Debating Society at  Coachmaker's-hall, <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> but not  often; and a few times to Covent-garden Theatre. These are all the opportunities     he ever has to learn from Public Speakers. As to Books, he had to wade through     two or three Folios, an <cite>History of England</cite>, <cite>British Traveller</cite>, and a <cite>Geography</cite>. But he always read them as a task, or to oblige us who  bought them. And as they came in sixpenny numbers weekly, he had about as many   hours to read as other boys spend in play.</p> <p style="text-indent:40px;"> I at that time read the <cite>London Magazine</cite>;  and in that work about two sheets were set apart for a Review... Robert seemed   always eager to read this Review. Here he could see what the Literary Men were    doing, and learn how to judge of the merits of the Works that came out. And I    observed that he always looked at the Poet's Corner. And one day he repeated a   Song which he composed to an old tune. I was much surprised that a boy of  sixteen should make so smooth verses: so I persuaded him to try whether the    Editor of our Paper would give them a place in Poet's Corner. And he succeeded,  and they were printed. And as I forget his other early productions, <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> I shall copy this.</p><br xmlns=""/>

					<div xmlns="" class="lg">
					
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">Hail, MAY! lovely MAY! how replenish'd my pails!</p>
					<p style="text-indent:160px;">The young Dawn overspreads the East streak'd with gold!</p>
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">My glad heart beats time to the laugh of the Vales,</p>
					<p style="text-indent:160px;">And COLIN'S voice rings through the woods from the fold.</p>
					<br/>
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">The Wood to the Mountain submissively bends,</p>
					<p style="text-indent:160px;">Whose blue misty summits first glow with the sun!</p>
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">See thence a gay train by the wild rill descends</p>
					<p style="text-indent:160px;">To join the glad sports:... hark! the tumult's begun.</p>
					<br/>
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">Be cloudless, ye skies!... Be my Colin but there,</p>
					<p style="text-indent:160px;">Not the dew-spangled bents on the wide level Dale,</div>
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">Nor Morning's first blush can more lovely appear</p>
					<p style="text-indent:160px;">Than his looks, since my wishes I could not conceal.</p>
					<br/>
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">Swift down the mad dance, while blest health prompts to move,</p>
					<p style="text-indent:160px;">We'll count joys to come, and exchange Vows of truth;</p>
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">And haply when Age cools the transports of Love,</p>
					
					<p style="text-indent:160px;">Decry, like good folks, the vain pleasures of youth. <a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="back5"> </a></p>

					<br>
					<p>[...] I remember a little piece which he called the Sailor's Return: in which he    tried to describe the feelings of an honest Tar, who, after a long absence, saw
                    his dear native Village first rising into view. This too obtain'd a place in the  Poet's Corner.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> And as he was so young it shews some Genius in him, and some   Industry, to have acquired so much knowledge of the use of words in so little time. Indeed at this time myself and my fellow workmen in the Garret began to   get instructions from him, though not more than sixteen years old.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> About this time there came a Man to lodge at our Lodgings that   was troubled with fits. Robert was so much hurt to see this poor creature drawn into such frightful forms, and to hear his horrid screams, that I was forced to   leave the Lodging, We went to Blue Hart-court, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BellAlley" title="Bell-alley">Bell-alley</a>. In our new Garret we  found  a singular character, James Kay, a native of Dundee. He was a middle-aged man,   of a good understanding, and yet a furious Calvinist. He had many books,... and some which he did not value: such as the <cite>Seasons</cite>, <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, and some Novels. These Books he lent to Robert; who spent all his leisure hours in reading the <cite>Seasons</cite>, which he was now     capable of reading. I never heard him give so much praise to any Book as to  that.<a href="#6"> [6]</a><a name="back6"> </a></p>
					
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I think it was in the year 1784 that the Question came to be  decided Between the journeyman Shoemakers; whether those who had learn'd without   serving an Apprenticeship could follow the Trade.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The Man by whom Robert and I were employ'd, Mr. Chamberlayne, of  Cheapside, took an active part against the lawful Journeymen; and even went so     far as to pay off every man that worked for him that had joined their Clubs.    This so exasperated the men, that their acting Committee soon looked for <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">unlawful men</em> (as they called them) among Chamberlayne's    workmen.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> [They found out little Robert, and threatened to prosecute  Chamberlayne for employing him, and to prosecute his Brother, Mr. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="G. Bloomfield">G. Bloomfield</a>, for teaching him.  Chamberlayne requested of the Brother to go on and bring it to a Trial; for that  he would defend it; and that neither <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a> nor Robert should be hurt.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In the mean time <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a> was much insulted for having refused to join upon this  occasion those who called themselves, exclusively, the <em>Lawful   Crafts</em>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a>, who      says he was never famed for patience, took his pen, and addressed a letter to    one of the most active of their Committee-men (a man of very bad character). In     this, after stating that he took Robert at his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother's">Mother's</a> request, he made free as  well with the private character of this man as with the views of the Committee.]</p>
					<p class="pnonident">This was very foolish; for it made things worse: but I felt too much to  refrain.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Robert naturally fond of Peace, and fearful for my personal  safety, begged to be suffered to retire from the storm.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> He came home; and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="Mr. Austin">Mr. Austin</a> kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could        return to me. And here, with his mind glowing with the fine Descriptions of   rural scenery which he found in <em>Thomson's Seasons</em>, he again   retraced the very fields where first he began to think. Here, free from the   smoke, the noise, the contention of the City, he imbibed that Love of rural  Simplicity and rural Innocence, which fitted him, in a great degree, to be the     writer of such a thing as the <em>Farmer's Boy</em>.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Here he lived two Months:... at length, as the dispute in the  trade still remained undecided, Mr, Dudbridge offered to take Robert Apprentice,   to secure him, at all events, from any consequences of the Litigation.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> [He was bound by Mr. Ingram, of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BellAlley" title="Bell-alley">Bell-alley</a>, to Mr. John Dudbridge. His  Brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a> paid five  shillings for Robert, by way of form, as a premium. Dudbridge was their Landlord, and a Freeman of the City of London. He acted most honourably, and  took no advantage of the power which the Indentures gave him. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George Bloomfield">George Bloomfield</a> staid with    Robert till he found he could work as expertly as his self.]</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> When I left London he was turned of eighteen; and much of my happiness since has arisen from a constant correspondence which I have held with  him.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> After I left him, he studied Music, and was a good player on the  Violin,</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> But as my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> had married a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteAunt" title="Woolwich woman">Woolwich woman</a>, it happened that Robert took a fancy to a comely  young woman of that Town, whose Father is a boat-builder in the Government yard  there. His name is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ChurchJoseph" title="Church">Church</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Soon after he married, Robert told me, in a Letter, that 'he had  sold his Fiddle and got a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="Wife">Wife</a>'. Like most poor men, he got a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="wife">wife</a> first, and had to get                     household stuff afterward. It took him some years to get out of ready furnished   Lodgings. At length, by hard working, &amp;c., he acquired a Bed of his own,                     and hired the room up one pair of stairs at 14, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BellAlley" title="Bell-alley">Bell-alley</a>, Coleman-Street. The
                    Landlord kindly gave him leave to sit and work in the light Garret, two pair of  stairs higher.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In this Garret, amid six or seven other workmen, his active Mind
                    employed itself in composing the <cite>Farmer's Boy</cite>.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> In my correspondence I have seen several poetical effusions of
                    his; all of them of a good moral tendency; but which he very likely would think  do him little credit: on that account I have not preserved them.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Robert is a Ladies Shoemaker, and works for Davies,   Lombard-street. He is of a slender make; of about 5 F. 4 I. high; very dark   complexion... His <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother">Mother</a>, who is    a very religious member of the Church of England, took all the pains she could     in his infancy to make him pious: and as his Reason expanded, his love of God  and Man increased with it. I never knew his fellow for mildness of temper and    Goodness of Disposition. And since I left him, universally is he praised by    those who know him best, for the best of Husbands, an indulgent Father, and     quiet Neighbour. He is about thirty-two years old, and has three Children.</p>

Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac Bloomfield">Isaac Bloomfield</a>, 9 May 1806<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">City Road. London. May 9<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1806</p><p class="pnonident">Dear Isaac</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Your letter this morning was not quite unexpected, for, from the                     consciousness of having been remiss myself, I had reason to suppose that you                     would or might probably be first with one. I long ago determined that I would                     not write to you untill I could announce the publication of my 'Wild Flowers'                    and send you a copy—and then close upon the Back of that came the                     'Illustrations' by Storer &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GriegJohn" title="Greig">Greig</a>, the two artists who visited you last summer. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> The first has been                     published some time, and after having been neglectfull in the first case, I                     resolved to send you the two Books together. The latter is just publishe'd, and                     I will certainly make them into a parcel, with some songs I have long meant to                     send you. and you will receive it by next Thursday night by Avey—But I write                     this quickly that you may have it tomorrow evening and know that the packet is                     coming.—</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> There is another material cause yet for my not sending to you                     sooner. Our Bookseller has been to Scotland, and has not yet settled my yearly                     account, upon which depends the payment of the dividends on account of the                     house, the intended fence of the garden, and my whole plans for the ensuing                     year. I have no doubt of having a settlement next week. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> With this preface on account of my long silence, let us proceed                     to other subjects I will certainly and cheerfully too, perform all in my power                     with respect to the anthemns, and will write in due time to Dr Mills, or any                     other you may name. I have every reason to believe that Mrs Park, (who has set a                     tune on the death of Nelson and requested me to forward a copy to you) will give                     her attention and support to such an undertaking. But I should think it material                     to you as to <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">who</em> is to look at the Music, I mean as to your                         <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">own</em> feelings and their judgement. Dr Hague of Cambridge                     has lately stood Editor and partly composer to a collection of songs (in number                     86) which are sold for 12 and 16 shillings; and though when you see them you                     will feel a conscious pride exceedingly well grounded, I wish to heaven you                     could get half his list of subscribers.— <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> It must first be known how many pages it will occupy; and how                     much it will or ought to sell for; then regulate the copies by the number                     subscribed for; and to get subscribers a small bill specifying particulars of                     the intended work, and the author, his children &amp;c, as far as you                     please, should be distributed, and I will endeavour that through <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GedgePeter" title="Mr Gedge">Mr Gedge</a> it shall be known to the                     Suffolk folks. I immagine that it ought to sell at 5 or 6 shillings, and that                     three or four hundred copies might be printed, but this is merely the thought of                     the moment. <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> You must ask yourself if you should                     like to send the MS. to London. If you do I will abide by your wishes in the
                    conduct to be persued.</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> You shall hear as to the Books and Music when I send them. At                     present it is 6 o'clock and I must be at Lombard Street by seven. My family have                     little to complain of except poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a>, who remains lame as ever.

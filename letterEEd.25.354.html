		<p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>, Beds. May 31. 1821</p><p class="pnonident">Dear Sir</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am glad that your remaining scruples have thus enabled me to   say a word on this important subject, for important it is and must be to me; but
                    you must let me have my own <em>stile</em> of writing or I can do  nothing. Put up with vulgarisms and take me as you find me.—I am realy glad that     you approve of my original plan to silence, or keep at a distance <em>all party</em>, but I shall have to recur to this subject  again—when I was first known in London I met, (without my seeking) a man related  to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Capel Lofft">Capel Lofft</a>, who, I soon found was  not only a deist but a writer in their cause. I soon found the shocking  inconsistency of keeping <em>him</em> company and others his betters  of different principles at the same time. I therefore dropd him, he thinking me   a silly young fool who wanted a ring in my nose and he to hold the string, and I     <em>knowing</em> him to be a boasting fellow whom I would not   trust three hours.—From that time came to me people of all descriptions—the     Unitarians were very busy. It is known that the late <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="D of Grafton">D of Grafton</a> often attended
                    the chapple in Essex Street, and a busy friend of mine thought perhaps that I    too might make a pretty little Unitarian, He therefore wrote the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="D">D</a> without my knowledge an
                    intimation that I would attend there, but feard that my attendance would look
                    like truckling to my great patron who sat in the gallery?—When I saw the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="D">D</a> again he askd me if I
                    knew a man of the name of ——? For he had recieved a letter respecting me
                    &amp;c. the good old man then said with an emphasis almost peculiar to
                    himself, 'I never wish to exert either power of persuasion over the wills or
                    opinion of any one living, I have never done so with my <em>own</em>
                    children, nor ever will.' Now the man who took this great liberty to write,
                    never to this days knows that I am acquainted with the affair!! What did he want
                    with me I wonder? It is not usual to get money out of poets! No, no it is not
                    the search after guineas, but proselites.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You have lately been amused and perhaps grieved by a report. Now
                    I will try to give you some of old date concerning myself.</p><p class="pnonident">1. The Morning Chronicle once said 'Bloomfield has a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">lucrative</em> place in the Temple,' adding, 'thus it seems he has not
                    courted the Muse unsuccessfully'<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a>—This
                    was copied into the American papers and most likely read by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HingstonElizabeth" title="my sister">my sister</a> in Virginia,—yet the
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">place was not</em> lucrative, and I never recieved but
                    twenty pounds. Twice to our knowledge I have been reported to be dead. I have
                    been advertised once to know if I was dead or alive!</p>
					<p class="pnonident">2d Mr Cobbet has ventured to tell his readers that I have been 'taken in tow' by
                    government to prevent me from writing in favour of the people <a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a></p>
					<p class="pnonident">3d—I once met with a painter in London who absolutely insisted that I had a place
                    of three hundred a year in the Stamp Office! I thought then that I knew better,
                    and my pocket has confirmd it since</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> See to what lengths <em>party spirit</em> will  go!!!</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> But to the point,—I say then there is not a man or woman living
                    who would or could say to <em>my face</em> that I have renounced the  doctrines of Christ or his Miracles.—There is not a soul upon earth to say 'you  are an enemy to the government of your country' Fools, cannot they see that the    <em>form</em> of government of a country is rather different to
                    the administration of it? Pray remember me to Mrs Baker and all who have    patience to hear of me. Yours dr Sir most respectfully</p>

					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> My eyes will let me say a few words more on the subject which
                        I hope will afterwards sleep for ever.—</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Cobbett and Hunt<a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> are men whom I would not trust with power; they   are too eager to obtain it.—Universal suffrage is an impracticable piece of
                        nonscense;—Republicanism will only do in <em>new</em> establishd   countrys: not in those which have been govern'd by Kings for a thousand  years.—</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> It is the natural bent and practice of <em>party</em> to go to extreems. Thus they could not let me rest even on                        the intermediate shelf of Scepticism but made me a Deist at once!!—I have                        been in the presence of great and <em>good</em> men, the Bishops                        Watson and Porteous,<a href="#4"> [4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> but then it is equally true that I have taken snuff
                        with Horne Tooke,<a href="#5"> [5]</a><a name="back5"> </a> and have held conversation with
                        Hardy* the Boot maker, who was tried for high treason!<a href="#6"> [6]</a><a name="back6"> </a>—Yea, more than all this, I had the    misfortune to be born only six miles from the birthplace of Tom Paine!!  This, to some ears would be horrible!—I shall go to worship again when I am
                        well enough; and when my dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Daughter">Daughter</a> and Sons<a href="#7"> [7]</a><a name="back7"> </a> can leave me in the

                        of 24 April 1819, where, on pp. 980–81, Cobbett writes 'the cause of the
                        people has been betrayed by hundreds of men, who were well able to serve the
                        people, but whom a love of ease and of the indulgence of empty vanity have
                        seduced into the service of the bribing usurpers, who have spared no means
                        to corrupt men of literary talent from the authors of folios to the authors
                        of baby-books and ballads. . . . None have escaped. BLOOMFIELD, the
                        Farmer's-Boy author was <em>taken in tow</em>, and was pensioned
                        for fear he should write for the people'. In a later work, Cobbett used
                        Bloomfield as an example of the personal dangers run by men who abandoned
                        their trades to depend on literature and, consequently, on the patronage of
                        the aristocracy. See William Cobbett, <cite>Advice to Young Men and
                            (Incidentally) to Young Women in the Middle and Higher Ranks of Life. In   a Series of Letters, Addressed to a Youth, a Bachelor, a Lover, a

                        Letter 1, 'To a Youth', paragraph 42: 'Stick, therefore, to the shop; rely                         upon your mercantile or mechanical or professional calling; try your
                        strength in literature, if you like; but, rely on the shop. If BLOOMFIELD,                         who wrote a poem called the FARMER'S BOY, had placed no reliance on the                         faithless muses, his unfortunate and much-to-be-pitied family would, in all                         probability, have not been in a state to solicit relief from charity. I                         remember that this loyal shoemaker was flattered to the skies, and (ominous
                        sign, if he had understood it) feasted at the tables of some of the great.
                        Have, I beseech you, no hope of this sort; and, if you find it creeping
                        towards your heart, drive it instantly away as the mortal foe of your
                        independence and your peace'.  <a href="#back2">BACK</a></p></div>

                            (1736–1812) was, by 1800, already a veteran campaigner for parliamentary      reform. Initially radicalised by the establishment efforts to exclude        newly-elected John Wilkes from parliament, Horne Tooke became an   organiser of societies dedicated to widening suffrage—including the     Society for Constitutional Information. He was arrested and charged with   treason in 1794 when, in alliance with the London Corresponding Society,
                            he attempted to organise a radical convention. Acquitted, despite the
                            bias of the judge, he continued to argue for parliamentary reform,
                            though in more moderate form.  <a href="#back5">BACK</a></p></div>

Although   acquitted, he lost his wife and unborn child—both died in childbirth     brought on prematurely by the stress of fleeing from a pro-government   mob. After his release from custody, Hardy gave up politics and carried
                            on his trade in Covent Garden.  <a href="#back6">BACK</a></p></div>

					<p align="right">London Oct 1. 1823</p><p class="pnonident">Madam,</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> We are sorry at having kept you in suspense respecting the
                    account; but we waited for the printers acct of Hazlewood Hall, which we have
                    not yet received; but whatever its amount may be is of little consequence.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> By the annexed statement you will see that besides 750 copies of
                    Hazlewood Hall, you have other books on hand to the value, estimated at the
                    regular price, of £734.7.6 against which we have a demand for £369.18.5. The
                    sale of Hazlewood Hall is very uncertain—therefore we don't at present estimate
                    it at any thing. We conceive therefore that in taking an estimate of the whole
                    value of the property—viz the books on hand, at what they would produce at a
                    trade sale, and the copyrights of which half of the whole were your fathers, the
                    highest estimate that could be put on the whole would be £600; but perhaps even
                    £500 would be enough for the purposes of the <em>Probate</em>.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> A new edition of the Banks of Wye is in forwardness, from which
                    some advantage is to be expected. Under the original agreement your father was
                    not entitled to any advantage from this until another 1000 copies should be
                    sold; but it has been recently agreed with the proprietors that he should
                    immediately have his half, as of the other works, on his admitting them to half
                    of the subsequent term of copyright. You are doubtless aware that Mr Bloomfield
                    gave up to us, for a certain consideration, one fourth share of the 'mayday',
                    and that afterward he sold us for £100 another fourth and half of Hazelwood
                    Hall; thus retaining, under the several arrangements, just half of every thing.
                    His death unfortunately diminishes the value of all the copyrights; because of
                    the three first, the term of 28 years will soon be expired—and as these are the
                    best books, they are very likely to be assailed by piratical editions—We shall
                    be happy to add to this statement any further explanations you may require—and
                    remain Madam</p>

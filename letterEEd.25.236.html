Friday Night half past ten </p><p class="pnonident">My Dear Madam</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You will wonder, I know you will, at my silence and perhaps ascribe it to ill-health, but I thank God I have no
                    such current coin to offer as an apology. I am indeed much better, and have even begun to sing, I don't mean sing in rhyming
                    composition, but, as the children say 'right earnest singing'. My back behaves pretty decently within the last fortnight, and
                    don't you see the buds coming? I congratulate you with a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">true heart</em> on your arrival with the Bairne, and you

                    little volms, the 'Topographical Cabinet' which show in very highly finished miniature some of the best remains in the

                    Thursday next, perhaps not, I have several things to accomplish first, and the more I write here the less I shall have to talk, so
                    good night, Catherine and Mary Ann are now fast asleep, and ditto, three of mine. I am not bent upon Thursday, and therefore open

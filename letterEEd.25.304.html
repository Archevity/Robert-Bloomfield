I am going to tell you all about it, and first of
                    myself. You will rejoice to hear that my Rhumatism is much abated, and that, by
                    acquiring <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">by force</em> a relish for reading, my November days
                    have past much better than I or you expected. I was yesterday to have dined with
                    the tennantry at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Chicksands" title="Chicksands">Chicksands</a>, but I am
                    tied to the fireside by an inflamation in my left ancle arising from a late
                    accidental blow on the shin by falling off my chair! You may stare, but I was
                    resting said left foot on the fender, when by an instantaneous slip I was thrown
                    completely off my balance, and struck my leg violently on the Brass top. We have
                    brought down the inflamation by vinegar and sound sopping, and all goes
                    well.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr Weston">Mr Weston</a> must have smiled at my
                    promise of sending you this on the day that I spoke of: that day was past, and I
                    am persuaded that the very day on which I was just double your age was no other
                    than <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles's">Charles's</a> birth day,
                    when you was at Winsor! You can recon it better than I.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> We did not forget your birthday, and I expect you will drink to
                    my next half century, next Tuesday week.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am sadly afraid that my friends have been too sanguine in their
                    hopes of the subscription. In Suffolk I hear of no more than £120 and in Kent
                    about £20. From London not a word of intelligence, Gloucestershire Do, though by
                    a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharp">Miss Sharp</a> as far
                    back as Sep 10<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>, I know that they are apprised of what is
                    on foot! In <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharps">Miss Sharps</a> letter
                    she informs me as follows. 'I must beg you <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">without delay</em> to
                    give you the name and age of your <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="second son">second son</a> and to state to
                    me distinctly and circumstancialy what your views for him are—. I mean to apply
                    to the Trustees of Lord Crew's Charities at Bamborough* in Northumberland, on
                    whom our families have peculiar claims—and it is not unlikely, (though far from
                    certain) but I may be able to procure ten pounds per ann for him for 5 years
                    either for education, or as an apprentice fee, but then I must set forth his
                    situation with some degree of precision &amp;c' The same letter says 'If you
                    think your <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="eldest son">eldest son</a> from
                    his infirmity of lameness stands more in need of assistance, I beg you will say
                    so, and give me the particulars of his case. It is immaterial to me which son it
                    is I apply for so long as I serve you, Indeed if for any reason you should deem
                    one of your daughters more immediately an object of interest, you may say so
                    &amp;c' I gave the necessisary information immediately to this excellent
                    Lady, but have not heard a word since. In another letter <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharp">Miss Sharp</a> informs me that by the
                    death her Cousin Jamima Sharp of Durham, an <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">immense

                    have not I told you how it would be a thousand times? I will carefully keep <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharps">Miss Sharps</a> letters for you, for
                    in the same epistle it is plainly stated that she has suffered a dreadful
                    disappointment as to the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">understood</em> distribution of the
                    property, and her calm and dignified manner of telling me so places her amongst
                    the highest class of Christian philosophers.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The Bloomfield's of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a>, and the Philips's of Barton are among the Suffolk
                    subscribers.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I did mean here to tell you a long story about the tattle of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Chicksands" title="Chicksands">Chicksands</a>, but if I attempt it now
                    the post will be gone, and leave you in suspence till Tuesday. I only assure you
                    that it <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">now</em> gives me not the least disturbance. You will
                    hear it all in due time—Last night the Honest Citizen John Peppercorn drank tea
                    and spent a great many animated words with me; it was very kind, and I like
                    it.—We are all well, and send a whole bag of Love to you, and to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr &amp; Miss Weston">Mr &amp; Miss Weston</a>, and I am

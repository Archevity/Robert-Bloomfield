Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary Lloyd Baker">Mary Lloyd Baker</a>, 10 January
                        1812<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">City Road. Jan 10. 1812</p><p class="pnonident">Memorandom.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> 'Some time ago, in the year 1811, or thereabouts, I had a valuable corispondent, and an invalid, name'd <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary Baker">Mary Baker</a>. When I last heard of her she was residing at Dawlish in Devonshire, and
                    never answering her letters in due time, and appearing to her, no doubt, as if I paid her very little attention, she at last slipd
                    through my fingers and I stood gazing around like a Greyhound when a Hare pops through a hedge!! However I am determin'd to leap
                    the fence and try to find what she's about.' And so</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Dear Madam</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> How do you do? But untill I hear your reply I can only send my love, not at all worn out, not even threadbare, and
                    proceed to talk about myself.—First then, I am well, thank Heaven! I have no rhumatism, but have stood the Autumn, and am bearing
                    the Winter magnanimously. My family circle have no complaints, except the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="2d Daughter">2<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> Daughter</a>, and that I hope, not serious. From what I think I stated to you last time concerning the
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wye,</em> you will expect a 2<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> Edition by this time, and so did I; but when the matter was
                    enquired into one Bookseller has, or had, 5 hundred copies which they have shared between them untill more are wanted, if that
                    should ever be the case. I have therefore not fully used your mutual critiques which shall be fairly and honourably treated if I
                    have the opportunity. And if you have occasion to write to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#FerneyHill" title="Ferney* Hill">Ferney* Hill</a>, wish you would
                    intimate so much to the party. Whenever I come to cut and hack the Journal again I will write to you or <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert" title="Mr Cooper">Mr Cooper</a> a general reply to your joint labours, where every one shall find out his
                    own answer as a man finds his Hat, by fitting it on.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I write now to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharp">Miss Sharp</a>, for I am realy afraid she is ofended, and
                    if I can perswade her that she has no cause I shall be a cleverer fellow yet than even you are aware of. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AnsteadMiss" title="Miss Ansted">Miss Ansted</a> calls sometimes to scold me, but what's that? she allways sends us mince
                    pies at Christmas, and my younkers look out for them as naturally as they do for the new Almanack. I am now writing in a little
                    cold parlour, and so far is my enthusiasm dampt that I would not give three farthings to be on the Summit of Penybale,**<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> NB. It is about 8 at night,
                    exceedingly dark, and a deep snow.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Well, now I have warm'd my toes, I want to make my respects to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Mr Baker">Mr
                        Baker</a>, and to send my love to the Children. The former, I doubt, finds abroad little remains of antiquity, and little to
                    analize but snow, and the latter like all other chickens are best under their mother's wing. How does the Genius of English
                    weather behave to you? Is it <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">realy</em> a milder season on your coast? I hope it is for your sake, and those in
                    like situations, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="My eldest Boy">My eldest Boy</a> after all his misfortunes, is hearty, and is
                    growing into a companion; and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="the youngest">the youngest</a> (under 5 years) is a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">celebrated</em> singer: no tune can escape him if he often hears it. and he sings with the utmost precision as to
                    time, and in the glee 'Come let us all a Maying go'—winds his gay infant tones round the subject as a Kitten climbs a pole.<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> Thus it is that parents always run wild in praise of their children, and most benignly was it contrived by
                    providence that we should feed our craving souls <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">at home</em> with sensations but a few degrees lower than
                    Heaven.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> We had a true London fog yesterday of which it would have been very desirable to send a part by every night and
                    day-Coach in England, that we might have gone 'Share and share alike.' But what is all this to you, at your distance? I hope and
                    trust I shall see you somehow, or somewhere in the ensuing Spring or Summer, and with this hope and my congratulations on your
                    partial recovery, and Respect to all friends</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Remain Yours, ever.</p><p align="right">Rob<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">t</sup> Bloomfield</p><p class="pnonident">* <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert" title="Mr Coopers">Mr Coopers</a> residence [note by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="T.

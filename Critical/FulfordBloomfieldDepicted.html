<p>On 5 October 1800 Robert wrote to his brother George as follows:</p>

<p>Sunday Night, October 5 Dear George,</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">One of the enclosed papers is a discontinued journal, it may contain some information. The other paper your good sence will teach you to Burn. My portrait was taken some time ago by a miniature painter named Polack the painting was about five inches high; the engraving will be publishd next month. I donâ€™t like the painting much. the print is published by subscription, for the benefit I believe of the engraver and the brother-in-law of Hood who employs him.</p>

<p>Bloomfield refers to the miniature painter Solomon Polack (c.1757-c.1839), who worked in London, exhibiting at the Royal Academy, after immigrating from Holland. The picture was engraved by Brown and published, 1800, by Vernor and Hood.</p>

<p>The portrait is owned by Bruce Graver and I am grateful for his permission to reproduce it.</p>

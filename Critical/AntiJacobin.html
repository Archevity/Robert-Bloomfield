		<h2><span class="titlem">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>, 11  (1802), 394–97</h2>
		
		
		<p>[Review of] <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Rural Tales, Ballads, and Songs</span>. By Robert Bloomfield. Author of the Farmer's Boy. Small 8vo. Pp. 119.	4s. Vernor and Hood. 1802.</p>
		
		<p>In the ANTI-JACOBIN, for August, 1800, we had the pleasure of calling public attention to the unlettered muse of this 'second	Burns'. We then beheld his rising genius with delight; listened, with pleasure, to the warbling of his 'native wood notes wild;'and we now hail, with increased satisfaction, the more matured flights of his well-fostered imagination.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In the Preface to this volume, which consists, principally, of <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Tales, Ballads</span>, and	<span xmlns="" class="titlem">Songs</span>, we are informed that 'the poems here offered to the public were chiefly written during the interval	between the concluding, and the publishing of "<span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Farmer's Boy</span>," an interval of nearly two years.' Some pieces,however, are of a later date.—Mr. Capel Lofft has <em>kindly</em> anticipated <em>our</em> labours, by			affixing <em>his</em> opinion to the <em>tail</em> of '<em>The Miller's Maid</em>,' one of the	most conspicuous articles before us, in the following words:</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> 'I believe there has been no such poem in its kind as the MILLER'S MAID, since the days of Dryden, for ease and	beauty of language; concise, clear and interesting narrative; sweet and full flow of verse; happy choice of the subject, and		delightful execution of it.'</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> From this decision we do not mean to dissent; though we cannot help smiling at the self-importance of the man, who,	throughout the volume, has tacked his criticism to the end of each piece. But the public, perhaps, may not be dissatisfied with		this; as, with the poems, they have also the annotations of the critic, by the assistance of which they will certainly be	competent to form an opinion of <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">their own</em>. A much smaller space, however, than the '<em>Miller's Maid</em>' would occupy, will afford room for the sweetly-simple and affecting ballad of '<em>Market Night</em>',which will fully enable our readers to appreciate the improved talents of our rustic bard.</p>

					<p>'<em>Richard and Kate</em>' is a pleasing pastoral; '<em>The Widow to her Hour Glass</em>' is a pathetic
					and interesting ode; '<em>The French Mariner</em>' evinces a noble and magnanimous spirit; '<em>The					Shepherd and his Dog Rover</em>' is highly poetical; indeed, there is not a single poem in the volume from the perusal of	which we have not derived pleasure.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Whether Mr. Lofft has exhausted his panegyrical epithets of <em>concise, clear, simple, easy, natural,	happy, pointed, characteristic, pleasing, singularly pleasing, animated, engaging, lively, spirited, solemn, generous,	graceful, sweet, affectionate, poetical, tender, affecting, pathetic, charming, beautiful, delightful, exquisite,</em>	&amp;c &amp;c. or whether the printer have been guilty of an omission, we know not; but, on closer inspection, we now find	that we were wrong in stating that that gentleman had <em>favoured</em> the public with a critique on <em>every</em> piece in the volume, for there is a '<em>Hunting Song</em>' which, <em>unfortunately,</em>	does not possess that <em>valuable</em> appendage.</p>

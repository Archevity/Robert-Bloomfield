		<h2><span class="titlem">Robert Bloomfield set to music, by Keri Davies</span></h2>
		
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		
		<p>The formal composition of settings of a poet provides an interesting measure of the reputation of a poet and the reception history of his oeuvre. It does not seem to link in a simple manner to qualities of musicality or melodiousness in the verse being set. Indeed, the example of Schubert (despite his Goethe, Schiller and Heine settings, Schubert concentrated largely on the dilettante or minor verse of his closest friends), shows how poetry of an indifferent, and even trite, calibre can be made into great songs. Perhaps great words can prove a hindrance to the composer, because they have too much life of their own and refuse to take a humble second place to the music. In the words of Boris Ford, ‘What suffices, as far as the composer is concerned, is that the words provide a theme, a drama, a sentiment, which lend themselves to being transformed into the finished song’ (xi). Nevertheless, it is often a pleasure to find composers setting good poetry as in the settings of Bloomfield listed here. Bloomfield’s work was granted musical setting almost from publication. In contrast, his near contemporary, William Blake, had to wait until 1876 for the first known composed setting of his words (‘On Another’s Sorrow’, for voice and piano by Doyne Courtenay Bell). There were a couple more Blake songs in the 1890s, and then a flood of compositions from 1900 onwards that still shows no sign of stopping. Today, Blake has probably overtaken Burns as the most set English-language poet after Shakespeare, whereas Bloomfield’s (and John Clare’s) settings remain few.</p>
	
		<p style="text-indent:40px;">This first search for musical settings of Bloomfield’s verse turns up just over two dozen compositions. Composers, too, are influenced by literary fashion (or Rezeptionsgeschichte as academics call it) and the fashion for Bloomfield was transitory, though intense enough while it lasted. For whatever reason, great or even significant composers seem to have avoided his work. The settings are almost entirely by minor, or amateur, composers – some, I think, stemming from personal acquaintanceship with the poet. The majority of these compositions were written within Bloomfield’s lifetime. There seem to be very few twentieth-century settings of Bloomfield. The works by Enfield, Jones, and Selby are all I can trace. The great exponents of English song: Gurney, Ireland, Vaughan Williams, etc., seem to have passed him by. Even Benjamin Britten, who one thought might have responded to a Suffolk poet like Bloomfield as he did to George Crabbe, failed to set any of his poetry.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;">Robert Bloomfield was himself a capable amateur musician who wrote with music in mind. Thus, ‘The Woodland Hallo’ is subtitled ‘(perhaps) adapted for music’. This list includes two separate settings of these words. Stephen Banfield points out that ‘words for music’, the poet having in mind a hypothetical or real melody as he writes his text, are an important traditional concept in Britain, accounting for many Elizabethan texts, and for much of the poetry of Burns and Moore. Amongst Bloomfield’s contemporaries, one might also note Byron’s ‘Stanzas for music’ and Shelley’s ‘The Indian serenade’ (first published as ‘Songs written for an Indian air’). In a letter to his brother George (8 September 1799), Bloomfield wrote, ‘You know that I have naturally (in common with the rest of the family) an inclination for music, and that I was formerly a beginner in the practice of it’.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;">The first published musical setting of Bloomfield is a song to the words of ‘Rosy Hannah’ by his brother Isaac. Isaac Bloomfield had some pretensions as a composer though lacking formal training. Robert sought the help of William Shield, Master of the King’s Musicians, in correcting Isaac’s songs for publication: ‘I showed him the songs, and left them with him; he says they want some trifling amendment in the bass, which he will do. Then asking if the three which I gave him were all Isaac had composed, I produced the sketch of “The Highland Drover”. … I left them all, and shall hear from him soon’ (letter to George Bloomfield, 23 June 1802). These songs are now lost. Isaac’s only other published work is a group of Six Anthems for the use of choirs where there is no organ (London, 1805?). Did Robert sponsor its publication? The sale catalogue of his library includes multiple copies, lots 172 to 179, of ‘Six Anthems, composed by Mr. Bloomfield’s brother Isaac’. There is a score in the British Library at G.517.a.(2.).</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;">Missing from this list are any settings by William Shield. Writing to George Bloomfield (23 June 1802), Robert comments, ‘have seen Mr. Shield; he is a man simple and unaffected in his manners to a striking degree, and ready to assist where he can. … Mr. Shield was so pleased with my “Poll Rayner”, that he has set it long ago, and has it by him (perhaps unfinished)’. Bloomfield’s publishers later proposed that Shield set the ballads included in Bloomfield’s <cite>The Banks of Wye</cite> (1811). In a letter to John Davy (10 July 1811) he writes, ‘A poem of mine, of considerable length, is now on the point of publication. It contains four incidental songs well adapted for music. The booksellers, who are half proprietors, fixed on Mr. Shield to furnish tunes, and he either will not, or cannot, do it. It is now left to me to seek a friend who will do it; not gratuitously, for your terms will be attended to. The music is intended to be printed with the book, and therefore will have an immediate and wide circulation. I remember your former attentions, and request to know if any such proposal can be listened to on your part, for you are highly capable of doing credit to the work’. The plan foundered when Davy, the Devon-born, London-based composer of popular songs, asked for a fashionable thirty-five guineas to set them. Like the majority of Isaac Bloomfield’s songs and Shield’s ‘Poll Rayner’, these ballad-settings by Davy, if they ever existed, are now long lost. The settings by Crotch, Firth, and Raper, below, are described as ‘glees’. The Anglo-Saxon term ‘glee’ referred to almost any type of secular part-song other than the often-bawdy canonic catch. From the mid-eighteenth century, and over the next century or so, the ‘glee club’, devoted to convivial part-singing, became a national institution. It grew out of the venerable tradition of male-only tavern music, which was becoming more wide-ranging towards the end of the eighteenth century – and more respectable, some of the clubs going so far as to admit female singers. The glee-singing world was musical, sociable and epicurean, yet in some ways extraordinarily isolated from the great developments of European music. In Bloomfield’s lifetime, the glee thrived as dilettante music, as did the light music of the pleasure gardens.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;">The most notable composer to have set Bloomfield’s verse is James Hook. Hook was born in Norwich in 1746, and came to London in the early 1760s, quickly becoming a prolific and successful composer. For nearly fifty years, he was organist at Vauxhall, writing over 2,000 songs, and knew a good commercial proposition when he saw it – setting a newly fashionable poet. He composed no fewer than five settings of Bloomfield’s poems between 1805 and 1810. Hook was also a successful music teacher, and Bloomfield clearly knew his Guida da musica instruction manuals, inventing words to some of Hook’s tunes (see The Remains of Robert Bloomfield, vol. 1, pp. 51-56). For some reason, almost certainly financial, Hook left London in 1820 without notice. The manager at Vauxhall kept his place open for a whole season, but he never returned. James Hook died at Boulogne in 1827.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;">The majority of settings of Bloomfield’s poems are solo songs like Hook’s. Particularly noteworthy is that by the German musician Nina d’Aubigny von Engelbrunner. Composer, performer, singing-teacher, Wynandine Gertrud (‘Nina’) d’Aubigny von Engelbrunner was born in Kassel, 15 April 1770, the second child of Johann Caspar Engelbrunner and Sabine Jacobine d’Aubigny. In 1803, she made her first visit to England, travelling with relatives to London. The same year saw the publication of her Briefe an Natalie Dber den Gesang, a pedagogical work for singers that Beethoven is said to have admired. She made a second visit to London in 1806 when she may have met Bloomfield, if the dedication ‘insc[r]ibed to Mr Bloomfield’ can be so interpreted. An inveterate traveller, she visited her sister in Calcutta in 1810, making a return visit to India in 1818. By 1826, she was in Vienna, and close to Schubert and his circle of friends. At an evening party (10 April 1827) given by her nephew Eduard Hornsteig, Nina d’Aubigny played harp, and Ludwig Tietze sang songs by Schubert accompanied by the composer himself. She died, unmarried, 27 January 1847. Nina d’Aubigny composed songs in German, French, and Italian. By setting Bloomfield’s poetry, she places him firmly in a context of cosmopolitan European high culture.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px;">The use of traditional tunes by poets, or the invention of their own melodies by poets, provides valuable insight into the musicality of a poet, how the lyric impulse is manifested, and the process of composition itself. Robert Bloomfield belongs with William Blake and John Clare, all poets known to have sung their own work, marking a return to the days of Thomas Campion and John Dowland, when musician and poet were the same person. By using traditional melodies as well as ones of the poet’s own composition, Bloomfield, like Clare, is not, as some allege, simply demonstrating continuity with an oral, predominantly labouring-class, tradition. He was writing at a time when European fashion for folk-song (and imitation folk-song) reached a peak as witnessed by the arrangements of traditional English, Scottish and Welsh songs by Haydn and Beethoven. Blake sang his verse to tunes of his own invention, now lost; Bloomfield to his own tunes and to traditional melodies. Bloomfield’s <cite>Selected Poems</cite>, edited by John Goodridge and John Lucas, includes the music of ‘Ligoran Cosh’, to which Bloomfield’s Song ‘The man in the moon look’d down one night’ is set. This tune is also mentioned by Walter Scott in Chapter 24 of The Bride of Lammermoor; its title is a poor transliteration of a Gaelic original. (Unfortunately, the editors chose to offer a late version of the tune, collected in Chicago in the early twentieth century, which leaves unanswered the question of what Bloomfield’s source might have been.) On 17 May 1803, Bloomfield was a guest at Dr Jenner’s 53rd birthday party, singing a song of his own composition in honour of the occasion. The music has not survived. For his sole venture into the theatre, <cite>Hazelwood-Hall: A village drama</cite> (1823), Bloomfield composed songs, ballads, and glees. Alas all lost.</p>

<h4>A provisional list of musical settings</h4>
<p>This list is intended to provide a basis for more analytical and wide-ranging research and criticism. It represents the results of searches through the catalogues of the British Library, and (for manuscripts) the Repertoire Internationale des Sources Musicales. Not included here are Bloomfield’s settings of his own words, since these are not musical settings in the strict sense in which the literary text is known to be anterior to the music accompanying it. I have also omitted the instances of Bloomfield devising words for existing music such as folk-tunes and musical exercises by James Hook. The arrangement is chronological by publication date (mostly derived from the British Library catalogue), or where possible, the actual date of composition. The sequence demonstrates clearly how Bloomfield’s reputation grew and then abruptly faded. Where possible original copies have been examined and form the basis of the bibliographic description.</p>

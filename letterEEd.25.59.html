                    Bloomfield, 24 October 1801<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Sat. 24 Oct: 1801</p><p class="pnonident">Sir,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I received your letter and I own having this moment received it,
                    I am much hurt by it.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I think there will be the height of absurdity in having the notes
                    to the octavos and quartos in a different form from those to the pocket vol. I
                    imagine all this is from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a>,
                    who, having done me a gross insult &amp; shameful injustice in the matter of
                    the Homer, wishes, as you may in time learn is usual, to exclude my name from
                    every part of your works and to make you believe my judgment of approbation is
                    greatly to be dreaded. I wish I had known your mind in time. I would not have
                    given my mind the trouble often very distressing of calling off its attention
                    from yet far nearer objects of its concern to write notes on your poems
                    excellent as those poems are, and much as I have regarded and am disposed to
                    regard their author.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I think I am as much at liberty to express my opinion of your
                    poems as the reviewers or any other person.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> However say if you please, and in any terms you please at the end
                    of the vol, that you disapprove my having done so; only do not forget to say
                    that you never hinted this disapprobation to me till all were printed.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> There could hardly I think be an instance of more concentrated
                    criticism, nor a more simple unexceptionable shape in which to offer it. What I
                    said of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames" title="Mr Fox">Mr Fox</a> I said less for
                    the sake of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames" title="Mr Fox">Mr Fox</a> than for the
                    sake of my country and posterity and mankind. If it may lead any portion of the
                    public to learn Better to distinguish than hitherto Between those who have
                    plunged us into such a war and so long kept us in it and those who would have
                    prevented our ever rushing into that direful whirlpool I have my chief
                    object.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I will certainly not alter the form of the notes. I was excluded
                    from any other part in this volume by your own express desire. I think I may say
                    in future that it is not likely that I should thus strangely offend. I do not
                    mean to write either note or essay to any future edition of any poems you may
                    publish in my Life-time. I assure I can very ill spare the time short as the
                    notes are. To have taken so avowed a part in the first publication and none
                    except that of corrector of the press and occasional emendator in this would I
                    think have had a strange and undesirable appearance for you and for the poems:
                    as if I had changed my mind as to you or them or both. Mind, I could not well
                    take any part that was more modest, or offer an opinion in fewer words. You, and
                    you say your friends in general, are, or <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">will</em> be,
                    dissatisfied with them and dislike my occupying even so small a space in your
                    works and so unobtrusive a station as the bottom of the page. I believe you will
                    find me assuredly resolved not to occupy any space at all in them in future;
                    only if I must not say what I think of you it would have been as well if you, in
                    your preface, had not said what you think of me. In future if I am to be silent
                    as to your praise in your publications I would request you to be so as to mine
                    reciprocally.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> But I hope it was not about such a matter as this that the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Duke of Grafton">Duke of Grafton</a> told me by
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RogersSamuel" title="Mr. Rogers">Mr. Rogers</a> that he meant to
                    call at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Troston" title="Troston">Troston</a>. I heard by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RogersSamuel" title="Mr. Rogers">Mr. Rogers</a> what I was glad to hear
                    as it concurs with my own sentiments, that 'The Miller's Maid' was a particular
                    favourite with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames" title="Mr Fox">Mr Fox</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Suppose you did read my praise of your poems in the proofs and
                    did not strike it out. What then? Did not you send me your praise of me to read
                    in your preface in the proof? If you thought it wrong that a man should revise a
                    proof in which a friend has said something in his praise you should not have
                    sent such a proof to me. I am ready at all times to do what essential services I
                    can, but such punctilios I do not like nor expect from a man of genius.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;">I remain yours sincerely,</p><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Capel Lofft">Capel

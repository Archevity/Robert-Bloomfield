Aug 15. 1815</p><p class="pnonident">My dear Girl</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I think we agreed before your departure that a week's silence was
                    not to alarm either party. I have been forced by various circumstances to take
                    advantage of it, and now write in reply to yours received last Sunday morning.
                    You see that I spoke truth when I assured you that you would find agreeable
                    associates, and a good reception. I shall be glad to recieve <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="Georges">Georges</a> long letter, but tell
                    him if he does not look sharp and finish it, there are likely to be two or three
                    more revolutions before he comes to a close. If he could only contrive to get
                    the Allied Armies from Paris I think Lewis would stop there about two hours; but
                    then it is no great sport to see a man with the gout run a race! But hold! I am
                    not going to bombard you with politicks, I have somthing more <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">solid</em> to state, which is, that soon after I wrote you last, I received
                    a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Mr L. Baker">Mr L. Baker</a>,
                    dated Abergavany, and this letter contained a £20 check, the gift of himself and
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert" title="Mr Cooper">Mr Cooper</a>! This is a glorious
                    lift.—I have again heard from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AnsteadMiss" title="Miss Ansted">Miss
                        Ansted</a>, advising me to write to the present Lord Mayor, Birch, with
                    respect to the school for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="Robert">Robert</a>. This is no bad thought, but I have not made up my mind to the
                    performance. I am perfectly well, but your poor brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> is gone towards
                    Bedford loaded with Irons! That is to say, gone with Adams measuring the
                    Reaper's work.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> It happens rather singularly that after you have so many times
                    abused the strolling players for never coming to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>, they should come directly you
                    was gone. Last night they perform'd 'She stoops to conquer,' but their Toney
                    Lumpkin was the only tolerable hand. I did not see them, but sent <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a>. From all
                    reports they are most wretched hands indeed. The Theatre was a Malthouse at the
                    Kings Arms, and they perform 'Lovers Vows' tomorrow.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have a letter at length from Mrs Philips, who did not receive
                    mine until a few days ago, she being not at Barton, nor, when I wrote, in
                    London. She is the same good wishing creature that I ever found her. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyCharles" title="Sir Charles">Sir Charles</a> of course has not
                    heard or seen my letter, but Mrs Phillips is coming to Suffolk very soon, when
                    she promises to see you and what else may turn up I know not.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Miss Radwell is visiting at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>, and she and Miss Weston are gone out on Horsback.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Tom Naylor set out last Sunday week for Ostend and Brussels.—Your

                    and is in the fair way to get every thing her own way. This is just what girls
                    like, and I am sure it will please you.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You will always remember me to your present entertainers, with my
                    sincere respects—and having now but little to add, and not liking this <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">hard work</em> of writing, and being sleepy, and two or three

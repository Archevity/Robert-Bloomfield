As to the Farmers Boy &amp; all future works of Mr
                    Bloomfield I have done with them. Had the printer &amp; publisher done me
                    justice this would have sufficiently appeared in my postscript to the
                    preface.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Mr Bloomfield has compelled me by a letter most unworthy of
                    himself &amp; me to renounce all correspondence &amp; conversation with
                    him for the future. And I have at length after 5 years plague &amp; torment
                    which he has been continually almost giving me done with him. It was time I
                    should when he could say by leter that he suspected the character he had heard
                    of me was false of my being a man of feeling &amp; unwilling to give any one
                    harm: and that if I came to town as I informed him I meant to do against <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames" title="Mr Fox's">Mr Fox's</a> funeral he was not in a
                    train to see me and should do every thing in his power to avoid me.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I wrote an answer of about 3 lines renouncing of course all
                    future correspondence &amp; conversation with a clown who would so forget
                    himself to me.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> He took a months time and then yesterday I received a note from
                    him in the Magazine Parcel just as if nothing had happened informing me of his
                    tour in Kent &amp; that since his return the printer had shown him my
                    Postscript that he askd whether they had printed it and was told no.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I wish you to see the postscript and to judge whether after
                    repeated [illegible word]-tions 4 or 5 times within 5 years every one nearly as
                    bad as the letter from which I have given you a specimen, that postscript were
                    not necessary and whether it were not mild moderate &amp; favourable. Be it
                    remembered with all this that mr Bloomfield never pretended to me any quarrel or
                    ground of quarrel with me but about the preface with which he seemd quite
                    content from the publication till after the 3<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rd</sup> edition
                    unless it be that I told him of 7 or 8 lines which are like any thing rather
                    than blank verse or any kind of verse which he chose to publish as a fragment
                    and which I wisht him to omit as disgracing several good verses of which these
                    were a part. May I request that if the Monthly Mirror &amp; Ladies Magazine
                    are still sent thither they may be sent in future to Mr Ingram of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Burys">Burys</a> London booksellers Messrs

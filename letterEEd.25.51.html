                        <a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p class="pnonident">Honoured Mother,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have just received a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Troston" title="Troston">Troston</a> which I copy with pleasure.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> 'I have another pleasing communication from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DyerGeorge" title="Mr. Dyer">Mr. Dyer</a> who is himself a good poet,
                    and a good critic, he says in a letter received yesterday "Yes Sir I have read
                    the Farmers Boy, and intend to read it over and over again some time hence.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The Farmers Boy appears to me a truly original and beautiful
                    poem, it recalled to my mind those ages and those countries in which the Poet
                    and the Shepherd were more naturally united; under those circumstances some of
                    the earliest Scotch Ballads were written; and they please us because they
                    breathe the language of nature and speak to the heart. Your Shepherd's Boy with
                    the poetical character that he undoubtedly possesses, requires indeed no other
                    name; poetry is more immediately the language of nature, and whoever has a
                    relish for such language must I am sure be pleased with Bloomfield, I can truly
                    say I have been charmed with his Seasons, and that my heart echoes back every
                    thing said by you in the preface.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Everything that I can say or do to forward so pleasing a poem, I
                    shall do with great pleasure, and even with pride, for it possesses that kind of
                    merit that every man must be proud to acknowledge and happy to see patronized
                    and rewarded.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am extremely delighted with the harvest Home, but I am most
                    pleased with Autumn and Winter; the wood scenery, swine and pigs feeding on
                    acorns and wandering in the woods, the Hunt — the disappointment — Night — the
                    Christmas fire — the sufferings of the post horse, are very characteristic, the
                    sheep-biter — moonlight — scattered clouds, ewes and lambs, the distracted young
                    woman is very affecting — the introductory part of spring I much like. The work
                    appears in a most pleasing form — I shall be glad to see him and am convinced
                    from his writings that he is an amiable man I perceive no fopperies — no
                    meretricious ornaments, no language of bigotry and enthusiasm in
                    Bloomfield."'</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Thus far <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DyerGeorge" title="Mr. Dyer">Mr. Dyer</a>,
                    <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft">Mr.
                    Lofft</a> goes on to say 'I have copied this from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DyerGeorge" title="Mr. Dyer's">Mr. Dyer's</a> letter because I wish you
                    and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="his mother">his mother</a> to see what is
                    said by the best judges of the Farmers Boy. I think what you said in a former
                    letter is very just, that his absence from the objects he describes with so much
                    force and feeling, and truth and beauty, was to him what loss of sight was to
                    Milton and his want of education (what is generally so called) has had its
                    advantages; if he had been learned, it would not have been possible that he
                    should have produced so purely original a poem.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I trust you will long enjoy those pleasures which you so justly
                    expect from his future correspondence; you that with all the sufferings you have
                    both had to struggle with, have so affectionately and so justly rejoiced in his
                    correspondence hitherto, appear to have a peculiar right to rejoice in his
                    better prospects, and in the new sources of knowledge and satisfaction, that I
                    trust are opening to him'.</p><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="G.B.">G.B.</a></p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>Suffolk Record Office,

Nov 30. 1815</p><p class="pnonident">My Dear Girl</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> This is the last and the dullest day of this abominable month. I
                    have stood it well, and am in sound heart and hope, though how I shall pay £60
                    of debt I know not, but I am determined not to sink under it. The reversion of
                    the Rural Tales takes place in Jany. and I have no body pressing; but what the
                    Booksellers will give me, or whither they will buy it at all is uncertain. There
                    is no money. Every class of the community are suffering and crying out, and not
                    without reason. This is what we get by thumping the French! I have a letter from
                    Binley, full of regrets and finishing with a dream! Our House is undergoing an
                    extensive repair or brush up, such as scarping the Brickwork, and painting, so
                    that by the time we are forced to turn out we shall begin to be very smart. Our
                    jay has caught the sound of wallscraping, and is at work from morning till
                    night. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> is
                    poorly with cold and toothache attended with a general kind of irruption on the
                    skin. She decidedly chooses rather to be a mantuamaker and milliner, than go to
                    service. With this project at present <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">only</em> in our heads I
                    think you cannot do better than to collect information on the subject before you
                    leave <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a>. Queries. Are there any
                    respectable persons in the above trades who get good livings? Do they take
                    pupils by indenture or by articles for about three years? What is their premium?
                    Consult <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LockwoodEdward" title="Mrs Lockwood">Mrs Lockwood</a>, who would
                    not place a young girl with improper persons. The Boys are still at home. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#OsborneGeorge" title="Sir George">Sir George</a> sent us another hare,
                    with an invitation to dine at the White Hart last Thursday. I remembered the
                    mischief I got by going last year, and declined the treat on account of
                    unfitness, and moderate health, the consequence was, that he sent the Butler to
                    know if I would accept of a Dozen of port! I jumpd at the offer, and shall drink
                    to you on Sunday, and shall hope to live through another year, which will make
                    half a Hundred. Thus far tolerable news, but the rest will make your heart heave
                    and render <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a> still more
                    detestable. You know that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Weston">Weston</a>
                    was formerly in the same state with Cowper, and you likewise know that he is
                    subject to that calamity when opprest with care and business.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a>
                    His sister is most unfortunately absent when he most wants her assistance. She
                    is at Oxford for a month to acquire at a first rate pelicce and Dressmaker the
                    art of cutting and fitting, and is making a rapid progress as that trade is one
                    of their objects when they go to Hastings. In this case you see <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">all</em> the great concerns of his transfer of trade and property, writing
                    his Bills, collecting his debts, and in a thousand other things fall solely on
                    himself, the consequence is that he is but a few shades from madness, and if it
                    increases another week he will be unable to attend to business! He insists upon
                    Sally's staying out her month, and though I have obtained her address he will
                    not suffer any one to tell her his situation. Mr Layman attends him closely, and
                    I have given him six hours in a day. He is perfectly sane and recollected at
                    intervals, and then comes on an impenetrable gloom, when you might just as well
                    reason with a milestone. His sister, (god help her feelings) <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">must</em> soon know it, and <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">must</em> be here whither he
                    likes it or no. Uncommon events, the executorship to his father's Will, the
                    arrangements for his sisters, together with hard travelling has brought him to
                    this. He traveld eight hundred and fifty miles in less than three weeks! I will
                    write you again in the middle of next week, for this is a heavy subject. I walkd
                    eight miles yesterday. N.B. he begs that if I feel it afflict my spirits, I
                    would keep away from him. Give my love to all friends, and be a good Girl.</p><p class="l"><em>Address: </em><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Miss Bloomfield">Miss Bloomfield</a>. / <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LockwoodEdward" title="Ed.

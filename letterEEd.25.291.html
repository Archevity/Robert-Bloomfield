                    what the whole City of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a> has
                    been doing, you will excuse my long silence. Your last announced the safe arival

                    was going to Mrs Hodge on Monday &amp;c, At that time a feast and
                    illumination was talkd of, to take place here on Wednesday, but I could not have
                    imagined that this little place could have exhibited any thing worth seeing or
                    worth your coming home for. And besides had I written for that purpose it would
                    have spoild your own plans in Town, and perhaps been impossible to accomplish.
                    Without further preamble let me proceed to give you a slight scetch of our late
                    uproar and mirth.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Sunday Afternoon, ye 3.<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> of July</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You will see by the above that I began to write to you yesterday
                    and this morning I had your letter complaining as you well might, of my long
                    silence. I am very glad you have seen <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Vauxhall" title="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</a>, as it will serve you instead of seeing <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">our</em> Vauxhall, which I would go on to describe, but that Miss Weston
                    and their party are just taken Boats mad, and want me to go with them to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Chicksands" title="Chicksands">Chicksands</a>, and here am I tied by the
                    leg with three younkers—So stop a moment—There, now go on.—I have evaded all
                    invitations, and shall walk with my companions after tea.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> —The principal inhabitants of this Town and environs form'd
                    themselves into a Committee to conduct the proposed festivities, and accordingly arranged
                    everything in respect to situation, numbers, and quality of those who were to
                    partake the Dinner. The Old Bellman was at work every hour proclaiming 1<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup> that all the Inhabitants were expected to ornament their
                    houses by 8 in the morning with green boughs, 2<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> All who had
                    tickets to partake of the feast, to bring with them, plate, knife &amp;

                    evening &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c—The whole intermediate time was employd
                    by every body, as it were by instinct, in all kinds of preparations. On Tuesday
                    evening boughs of Oak became general, but on Wednesday morning, early rising had
                    brought into the town many Waggon loads of large limbs of Oak reaching to the

                    Town employd in gathering Wild broom, Roses, popies, and blue cornflowers, and
                    working them into wreaths, till every door and window in the place was
                    decorated, and appear'd to say 'Rejoice!' The Street from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Weston's">Weston's</a> to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Inskip's">Inskip's</a> was a perfect grove
                    interspersed with White flags of all sizes and shapes, and 'flowers of all

                    (between thirty and forty) of the Townsmen on horseback with white favours, (for
                    we all mounted the cockade) preceeded by a Herald on a White Horse—The forman

                    in his hand a roll of paper by way of Trunchion. This worthy was no other than

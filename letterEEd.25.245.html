                    silence had I not unfortunately a tolerable excuse to urge, which, though I
                    write in extreme pain, shall not make its appearance until the fag end of the
                    epistle.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The first thought that came across my mind on the receipt of
                    yours was, a glow of self approbation, for having by some means or other so far
                    obtain'd your good wishes as to induce you in hurry, and on business, and in the
                    midst of a journey to think of me and to steal time to write. You must certainly
                    take a pleasure in oblidging, and that is the very essence of all that is good
                    upon earth, as far as earth is concernd.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The Cheddar Cliffs have taken up a nook in my heart, and
                    imagination scratches a picture of her own, like an old Hen in a garden.</p><p class="pnonident"> I had taken a momentary dislike to Old Scoop, <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a>* but you strengthen my original feeling and I begin to think
                    that He may be a personage not <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">altogether</em> to be ridiculed.
                    I have a great mind to keep him alive.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Have you ever seen two or three local publications by Mr Heath a
                    printer at Monmouth? A fund of information may be glean'd from them all
                    immediately relating to our late expidition to paradice. Historical and minute
                    descriptions relative to Kyrle, to Ross, Willton Castle, Goodrich, Coldwell,

                    was present at the 'Horkey' and with many of the persons who figured there
                    thirty years ago when I was 13 years old. There is a fund of gossip cut out for

                    a Jubilee, and to crown it all my brother's family postponed on her account the
                    celebration of a Christning. Thus, by having a family meeting we beat all the
                    Doctors for we killd more than two birds with one stone.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have been <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">forced</em> to read a large Volumn
                    which has in the end given me much pleasure. Dr Parkinson's 'Organic Remains of
                    the Antediluvian World,' treating of the transformation of vegetable substances
                    into stone and Cole &amp;c. <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> I have besides borrowed old Stowe <a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="back5"> </a> and been diving into
                    the former state of this great city with very great satisfaction. When I last
                    wrote to your <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Cousin Catherine">Cousin Catherine</a> I
                    told her I could not read; it was true but I have greatly got over it since. I
                    have even, (being inspired by Heath's books) new modelled my journal, and hope
                    to fetch up what I have lost by idleness or by indisposition, and to make a
                    somthing of it yet. I am better pleased with it than I ever have been
                    before.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> What joy it must be to you to come home to your children and find
                    them well! For yourself it appears that travelling agrees with you, and you
                    should take the remedy upon all possible occasions.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> One day in the <del>Winter</del> Summer when
                    for a long time I had heard nothing from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ClareHall" title="Clare Hall">Clare Hall</a> or from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Fulham" title="Fullham">Fullham</a>, I
                    trudged to the latter place and found that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpMrs" title="Mrs Sharp">Mrs Sharp</a> had much recoverd, and that the family were then at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#WickenPark" title="Wicken">Wicken</a>. While on the bridge I saw a                     most beautiful sight. A Rain bow of most singular strength and breadth of
                    colours; it appeared in the east, the right foot resting on the surry shore,
                    just on the bank, so that the tide being full, and the water unruffled, its
                    shadow was <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">quite</em> as perfect as itself and form'd nearly a
                    circle, thus. [sketch of a circle]. The house on the right bank has a white
                    front which the prismatic colours renderd more striking than any thing I ever
                    observed of the kind. I have had a very kind letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert" title="Mr Cooper">Mr Cooper</a> pray put in a word for me
                    there if I should be mention'd. I look with much anxiety towards the health of
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperCharlotte" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a>. And how is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Mr Baker">Mr Baker</a>? Will he change his
                    Gout for my Rhumatism? You see here that grumbling must come in at last.
                    November is a trying month to me. I have been a week totally disabled from work,
                    or from resting above ten minutes in a place. I hope nevertheless to tell you a
                    better story soon. My sincere respects are due to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Mr">Mr</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mrs Baker">Mrs Baker</a>, and tell Catharine and
                    Mary Ann that if my back does not mend shortly I shall for a certainty forget
                    all my dancing. And with welsh scenery in my imagination and welsh [word
                    deleted] flannel to my skin I am, Dear Madam your very much oblidged, but tardy
                    friend,</p><p align="right">Rob Bloomfield</p><p class="pnonident">P. S. I have this minute been reading your letter to my daughter and she
                        naturally ask'd on the mention of your <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpMrs" title="Aunt James S">Aunt James S</a>. 'which Mrs S. is that'. I reflected for the first
                        time, and that for the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">first time</em> carried me to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ClareHall" title="Clare Hall">Clare Hall</a>, for I had fixd the
                        reference to Durham, and your friends there—It may be possible that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpMrs" title="Mrs Sharp">Mrs Sharp</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Catharine">Catharine</a> are now with you. If
                        they are what a most brilliant figure I should make at an apology at the
                        table! I have rather wonderd that I have heard nothing from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Barnett" title="Barnett">Barnett</a>, and been sadly unwilling to
                        believe that any other cause for it than absence could have been found,
                        where people write so frankly as we do, This is however a hole in a dark
                        staircase; a light thrown on the subject. I therefore charge you with my
                        love to All <del>tog</del> together — </p>

						I too the mountain pile can rear<br>
						Outdone, there shall be just such here.'<br>
						Then stript at once to set about it,<br>
						(Look at the spot and who can doubt it,)<br>
						But, at the moment he was speaking<br>
						His limbs were stiff, his back was aching,<br>

                                plain,<br>
						And with a gnashing envious smile<br>
						There stuck his spade upright the while,<br>
						And chang'd his mind.—Then sprewing first,<br>
					O'er Severn's Vale a cloud of dust,<br>
					Again he pluck'd it from the ground,<br>
					The crumbling earth flew wizzing round;<br>
					Then dashing sternly to and fro,<br>
					He cut a casual hole or two;<br>
					In one of which (a sweet one truly)<br>
					Some modern pigmies built up Uley<br>
					And <em>Owlpen</em>, by the dark wood side,<br>
					Which none can find without a guide.<br>
					And here, the happy natives stroll<br>
					Around their green illshapen Bowl,<br>
					A Bowl all zigzagg'd round about<br>
					With one large gap to let them out.<br>

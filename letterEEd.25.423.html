                        of Wye</cite> is but faintly to express my feelings. I am astonished at the  command of language you possess when I consider your youth; Oh how grateful you ought to be to providence and to your excelant parents for your education!!—the   mastery of language may be acquired by <em>Education</em> but the  poets <em>art</em> canot be <em>taught</em>. the <em>allusions, Similes</em>, and all the decorations of poetical   omposition, can be employ'd but by a few, I could point out 6 or 7 very happy    poetical strokes in that little poem (or at least such they appear to me) but I     forbear, to you I am an entire stranger you know not but I may wish to <em>praise</em>, whereas at 3 score and 10 I feel it my Duty to deal in <em>truth</em> only you have heard no doubt that <em>grey-beards</em> will prate, I claim the priviledge of a <em>Grey-beard</em> to be allow'd to advise you to be very <em>cautious</em> how you indulge your bent for poetical composition I said
                    above how grateful you ought to be to your parents for your Education &amp;c    your gratitude ought to evince itself, in your steady, active, persute of <em>Business</em>, I mean you ought not to let the charms of poesy  allure you from what we terms the <>main chance</em> I should not    have been guilty of such freedom had I not been quite certain you are possessed of poetical powers, <em>The marks are</em> upon you</p>

					<p class="pnonident">If Sir, you are tired, (as I dare say you are) of this string of proverbs, I beg leave to say I am not going any farther that way; the proverbs are from a small  voloumn of poems, which that excelant man the late <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GedgePeter" title="Mr Peter Gedge">Mr Peter Gedge</a> so kindly printed <em>at his own risque</em> for my Brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nathaniel">Nathaniel</a>; proverbs are very good  things in their way, <em>example</em> is better than precept, a few  particulars of my <em>misspent</em> life I think may warn you, In   early life like you I had a great bent for reading soon had read all the Books   <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my mother">my mother</a> possessed, it   happened we had a relation in the village who had many Books and who took great

                    Pit, Beckford, Sawbridge, John Wilks, Dr Price <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PriestleyJoseph" title="Dr Priestly">Dr Priestly</a> &amp;c     &amp;c<a href="#5"> [5]</a><a name="back5"> </a> In short by the time I was 12 my                    vanity was wonderously improved, I was apprenticed at Thetford, where I saw <em>both</em> the papers, and still indulged my favorite persuit,
                    reading all the Books I could borrow, I started off to London as soon as my time                   came out, and happening to lodge in a family who were Wesleyan Methodists I went                    with them to their class and prayer meetings &amp;c, I read every thing I                   could borrow on the subject of <em>Religion</em>, but curiosity led    me to the Tabernacle to hear Witfields preachers roaring away under the banners   of <em>Calvin</em>, tearing the poor <em>Arminians</em>
                    to rags, <a href="#6">[6]</a><a name="back6"> </a> and often went to hear the famous Mr Romaine

                        <em>poets</em> were so extreemly cautious of commiting                    themselves on <em>paper</em> I actualy became a corrispondant of                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyCharles" title="Sir C Bunbury">Sir C Bunbury</a> Esq and 20

                    queries by servants &amp;c which as I never would be seen if I could help it
                    caused me to lose much time and slur a great deal of beautiful white paper, the
                    private friendship and assistance I received from Bob amply paid me for my loss
                    of time &amp;c. and when they prevailed on me to be a <em>Master</em> (in that which is now Mrs Armstrong the Hatters shop) my <em>Sheepishness</em> increased so as to inspissate me, And besides
                    it pleased God to take from me my Excelant wife. The Gentlemen the Great friends

                    raised upwards of 30 pounds, still I was wretched, I had lost all my fireside
                    comforts It was soon discovered I was going to marry a young widow with 4
                    childrens!! And as I had 5 we had 9 to begin the world with, this imprudent step
                    displeased some of my great friends, But Mr Smith <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyCharles" title="Sir C Bunbury">Sir C Bunbury</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GedgePeter" title="Mr gedge">Mr gedge</a> and many others continued to

                    have (to late) been brought to my senses, In the 20 years that have past in my
                    present marriage I have seen most of my Brothers great friends removed by Death,
                    it is one of the great trials of those who live to be old, they outlive those
                    they love, and those who were able and wiling to help in Time of Need, were that

                    years, but for whome I must have been in a workhouse years ago; still how

                        success in the Seven Years' War but who later, ennobled as Lord Chatham,
                        presided over the unpopular refusal to let John Wilkes take the seat in
                        parliament to which he had been elected. Alderman William Beckford was a
                        wealthy plantation owner who, in 1770, when Lord Mayor of London, became a
                        Whig political hero by supporting John Wilkes's campaign to be allowed to
                        take his seat. Wilkes, journalist, pornographer, campaigner for the
                        extension of the franchise was the centre of popular protest, culminating in
                        London-wide riots, when he was excluded from the House of Commons although
                        elected by a majority. Alderman John Sawbridge, also a Lord Mayor of London,
                        was one of Wilkes's coterie. Drs Richard Price and Joseph Priestley were
                        Unitarian theologians and political writers who supported Whig campaigns for
                        the reform of parliament and, in 1789, welcomed the French Revolution, both
                        as a model for the revolution they hoped would occur in Britain and as a

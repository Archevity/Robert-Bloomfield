Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah Bloomfield">Hannah Bloomfield</a>, 31 July
						1805<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Worthing. July 31. 1805</p><p class="pnonident">My Dear Girl</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> We received your Letter on Sunday, and the parcell last night. I am afraid you sent us all your crop of
					Raspberry's, they are a good sort, but no fruit is sweet hitherto this cold Summer. Order Coals at Mr Weston's, and say that your Father will settle for them when he comes home. Call
					and pay the income Tax and take a receipt. You are to buy a yard and half of Cambric Muslin and make <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> a Frock.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Go to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood's">Mr Hood's</a> and ask for two mirrors, and two Museums,<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> and pack one of each in a small parcell, and Direct it, '<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Capel Lofft">Capel
						Lofft</a> Esq. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Troston" title="Troston">Troston</a> Hall, near <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a>. Suffolk' write a note with it to say that your Father is from home, and what you please besides.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Mr Norton of Colebrook Row, Islington, brings this to town; I write now to Mr Naylor and to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Mr Park">Mr Park</a>. We dined at Mr Norton's the day after you went home. I have seen them catch
					flat-fish and pickd up plenty for our suppers and the folks down stairs. The nets drew ashore a great many Scuttle fish, not with
					the shell which you have seen, This is the live fish after he has cast his shell. they are now not more than five inches long,
					round, and transparent like a long bladder of water. they have long feelers round the head, and contain a quantity of black liquid
					which if you throw them down they will spurt out to the distance of a foot, and then lie exhausted. They grow large before they
					cast their shell. They caught a Sea Serpent, and Eels, and several sorts of flat fish, young Sprats, and a large headed fish about
					8 inches or less in length, which has a sharp poisonous fin on his side with which he can wound you and cause swelling and pain
					for a week. One small fish was drawn on the sand, with round fins in size and colour like those of the beautiful blue Butterfly
					spotted like them and still more bright. I faild in securing him, for the net buried him in the sand.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Mr Harris, (father in law to Mr Norton) gave <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> a ride
					yesterday on a neddy. Mrs Spooner wrote to offer the use of her Library and Newspapers. Your <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="mother">mother</a> is midling, and is quite pleas'd with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary's">Mary's</a> Letter. and yours is quite to the point. Only when you have written
					your letter, read it over and make the rests, or stops, which the sentences seem to require, and then see if you have made them
					with your pen, if not put them in, and this will accustom you to write inteligably to any one.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You shall have a letter every Tuesday in future.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Our Love to you both, and to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a>, and Grandfather,

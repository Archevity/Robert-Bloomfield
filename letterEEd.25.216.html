                        1807<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">City Road. London. </p><p align="right">Oct 2. 1807</p><p class="pnonident">Mrs T Baker</p><p class="pnonident">Dear Madam</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> My Coat came safe to town, and tho' no letter accompanied it, I was certain from the direction being in your hand,
                    that I should soon hear from you. Thanks for your friendly account of your amiable neighbours, and late fellow travellers. Do be
                    so good as to make my respects to them, and say that I have not forgot any of my promises to them, but shall at some future time
                    send <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperRobert" title="Mr Cooper">Mr Cooper</a> the 'Illustrations' and return his Voll<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ms.</sup> of <del>Daubney</del> Daubeny's Guide to the Church. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> I likewise hope to send that exceedingly <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">petulant, arrogant</em> and <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">illnature'd Girl</em>, <del>my</del><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperCharlotte" title="Charlotte C.">Charlotte C.</a><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="my Brother's"> my Brother's</a> tune to my Highland Drover. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> But of all this I will write more in due time. And you will here probably ask yourself, what does he                     mean by due time? Why I mean that when you have fulfilld <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">your</em> promise, and sent me your Wye Scetches to copy,                     and the said copying is done. I mean to have the pleasure of exhibiting to you and them my whole triple-page'd Journal, Drawings,
                    prose, and rhime.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Since my return I have spent an evening at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Fulham" title="Fulham">Fulham</a>, very delightfully. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#OwenRobert" title="Mr and Mrs Owen">Mr and Mrs Owen</a>, and a Sweedish Gentleman, <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">the <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="link_ref" href="people.html#DeGeerGerard" title="Baron De Gear">Baron De Gear</a></em>, contributed to make me forget that, I was from home, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpWilliam" title="your Father">your Father</a> to forget that he was old. The latter, I assure you, <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">in
                        appearance</em>, gives me less apprehensions of <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">speedy</em> dissolution than I was prepare'd to expect. The
                    Sweed talkd of the scenery of the Baltic, Mr O talk'd of the Alps, and of the passage of mount St Gotherd &amp;c, —and I—What
                    could I talk about?—The <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wye</em>, to be sure!</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have made a Harp for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Catharine">Catharine</a>, and carried it to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ClareHall" title="Clare Hall">Clare Hall</a>, and there met <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrotchWilliam" title="Dr Crotch">Dr Crotch</a> and
                    family. They are all as jovial as music can make them, And all well. During this visit I was favourd with a copy of your <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blank Verse</em> tribute to the Queen's Oak, and shewd a Sonnet besides on the same Subject, which Sonnet brought
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Kate-te">Kate-te</a> and I as near to a quarrel <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">as ever we were</em> in our
                    lives; for I could not for the life of me call to mind that I had ever heard it before. The <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blank</em> Verse I
                    rememberd to have heard, or read in the garden at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Fulham" title="Fullham">Fullham</a>, and If I then saw or heard the
                    other, I think you must have read it to me and smuggled up the name of the writer, in which case I find a tolarable hole to creep
                    out at. You have allso dresst Wake's Oak in rhime, And if you go any further in personal compliments to your H. S. I shall begin
                    to suspect what I would not have true for two or three such <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">working day worlds</em> as this, Either that you
                    rather exceed the sober rating of my performances; or, that you are contented to pull the reins of your fancy, and to <del>quench</del> check superior abilities, and to come in second by choice, perhaps because you don't like to
                    be stare'd at; Hey!—Well well, take your way Lady; take your way.!</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have not yet found that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrantAnne" title="Mrs Grant's">Mrs Grant's</a> poems are publishd.

                    and I will take as much care of them as I would of you. I mean seriously to get some command of the pencil during the next year or
                    two, so remember that I am at school.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> To <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ" title="Mr T Baker">Mr T Baker</a> I beg to be particularly rememberd and hope that

					publishd in the Bury paper <a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> had not my sanction. I had nothing to do with it; but I have both
					an interest and a feeling of right and duty in contradicting &lt;it&gt;, which I will use immediately.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> On the receipt of your last, containing such fair and liberal offers, I was rejoiced, and immediately gave a copy
					to the Rev<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> M<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Stewart <a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> in this
					Neighbourhood, who was likewise struck with the honourable offer on your part, and with the superior chance of its being a more
					eligable as well as a more productive plan than a plain <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">dry</em> subscription. M<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Stewart
					wrote to the parties in Suffolk, your sentiments next day, so that whoever wrote the publishd Notice must be informd long ere this
					time that it containd the error of which you have so much reason to complain. I will take effectual means to prevent its
					reappearance in next week's paper, and to give them the truth. The same shall be done with Next Month's Magazine but when you say
						<em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">New</em> Monthly, do you mean that publishd by Sir R Philips, or a more modern one? <a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;">I have good reasons for thus mentioning M<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Stewart, for he acts as a voluntary agent between
					myself and my friends. We canvass'd the matter over for two hours, and concluded that if the four Vollms could be printed in a
					superior stile, in <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two Vols large Octavo</em>, it would be more acceptable than in one Vol. But here we wanted
					&lt;[illegible word]&gt; a Bookseller at our elbow, to say whether it could be sold for a guinea &amp; half, or 2
					Guineas? The latter, he thinks would make its way quite as well as the former. Thus you see Sir, that I am still in the dark as to
					the probable number of names to be collected, and as to the probable &lt;actual&gt; expence of each copy. It appears to
					me, Solus, that the first thing to be ascertaind is, whether the four Vol<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ms</sup>, (all that I have written) can be
					so printed as to warrant such a price? If so, perhaps it might at once be said publickly, that an Edition at such or such price
					was printing, or would be printed to supply whoever chose to subscribe before a given time, and that no more would be printed than
					subscribed for? but this is a mere thought of my own. I cannot stir in this matter untill the road is quiet before me, but lie
					like a Tortoise in a Wheel-rut, and then get up when I see opportunity.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Whatever comes of this measure ultimately, I shall be glad if you would take to yourselves the merit you deserve,
					and if I am a gainer in pocket, remunerate yourselves by all means in any way that your candour and honour may dictate.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> It happens that I have not &lt;a&gt; copy of Banks of Wye in the house, and cannot therefore supply my <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Country</em> friends who are now in London. I have an order similar to the last, to send to 'Mr Coates, No 19,
					Brewer Stt, Golden Square' <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2 Setts</em> of my poems, (a set containing Farmers Boy, R.T. W.F. and Banks of Wye).
					If I had them here I would not trouble you, but if you have a boy who could take such an errand in his rounds I should feel
					greatly obliged.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I thank you Sir most sincerely for your last letter, and for the good wishes and good advice at its close. Your
					wishes may perhaps be fulfilld, but your advice I am afraid I cannot act upon for want of the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">stuff</em>. But let

								<cite>Farmer's Boy</cite>, and other entertaining Poems, is now residing in the parish of Shefford, in Bedfordshire,
							under considerable embarrassment, which his delicacy has induced him to conceal; and that the conditions of his
							engagements with the booksellers prevent him from relieving himself by a new edition of his former works, or by a new
							publication. It is therefore, proposed, to open a Subscription in his favour, as well for the purpose of expressing the
							sense entertained by his countrymen of his unassuming merit, as of supplying him with the means of immediate comfort. Mr.
							Deck, of Bury St. Edmunds, will receive subscriptions, and account to the subscribers for the application of them. Suffolk
							is a rich, respectable, and enlightened county, and will answer this appeal, there is no doubt, with ardour and
							promptitude: and it is hoped, that the example will be followed by all lovers of nature and genius.'</p><p style="text-indent:40px;">Mr. GILLET, of Crown-Court, Fleet-street (the printer of this Magazine), has undertaken to receive the contributions of

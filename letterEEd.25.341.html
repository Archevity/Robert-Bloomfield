Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah Bloomfield">Hannah
                        Bloomfield</a>, 8 September 1819<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Wednesday Sep 8. 1819</p><p class="pnonident">My Dear Hannah</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Once more I write almost on the same topics; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Uncle Nat">Uncle Nat</a> was a little better on
                    Sunday and Monday and ate some plum pudding and the fat of Roast pork, and for
                    the first time regained the sense of <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">tasting</em>, but yesterday
                    he was bad again in the same old way, and is now in as doubtful a state as ever
                    his patience has lasted out wonderfully, but he now wants to go to an hospital,
                    where great cures are performed, or any where out of the way. He is perfectly
                    sensible and fond of conversation but plagues himself about his work both
                    sleeping and waking.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> On Saturday I rode to Paddington and had a long intensive search
                    for a dwelling but about there the houses are large and very dear. I find I
                    still like the City Road, but that is undergoing a great change for the large
                    gardens on each side by the Old Turnpike are cutting up to form a Basin for the
                    Regents canal.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Baldwin's">Baldwin's</a> reply was in these words
                    'We thank you for giving us the first offer of your new poem, and shall be happy
                    to see it whenever you please. There is no doubt but we shall be willing to <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">treat</em> for the purchase of either of the half or the whole,
                    and I should hope that nothing would occur on either part to obstruct the
                    completion of an arrangement to our mutual satisfaction.'</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> In consequence of this I leave the M.S. with him to day, and
                    shall soon hear from him I hope. I dined yesterday at Sutterby's and met <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Mr Park">Mr Park</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HollowayWilliam" title="Mr Holloway">Mr Holloway</a> &amp;c—<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldJames" title="James">James</a> seemd disappointed to find
                    no mention of himself in your last, and said at parting that he wants you to
                    write '<em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ducidly</em>': he is not so well this hot weather, and if
                    he could he would go to Margate by the steam packet, but will wait till you
                    come, this he said more from his wishes than his hopes, and was quite himself
                    before we parted. Write to him for he enjoys it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> was well on
                    Saturday, and I am quite well in spite of this distressing double anxiety on
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="my Brothers">my Brothers</a> account, and on my
                    own. I think of your dull situation almost every hour, and of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles's">Charles's</a> suspense but I
                    have heard nothing further from Mr Judkins, my mind is indeed too full, but I
                    must very soon be able to guess at what I may expect for my poems, and then, and
                    not till then I can properly know what to be at.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I learnd yesterday that 'Hayleys life of Cowper,' brought him, in
                    a short time, <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">six thousand pounds</em>, and he afterwards sold
                    his right for <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">five thousand</em> more!<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> But don't
                    let this lift up your hopes and your ambition to break your necks in the coming
                    down, I know how to hope within compass, but will get what I can.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I will write again on Monday, perhaps I shall have heard from

                    parcel send back a canvas wrapper which was borrowd to send the Oysters, and
                    send a bundle of the small useless children's books which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="Rob">Rob</a> is too old to read;

<p>In the year <i>1769</i> our Esquire at <ref target="places.html#Honington">Honington</ref> (Mr Quince [1]) had a party of <i>Gentlemen</i> Boys at his House On a Visit to Master Quince, the Young Norfords [2]  from Bury &amp;c,—My Self and Brothers were invited as Mrs Q knew though we were very poor, our Mother took all possible care of our Morals,—The young Gentlemen proposed Squirrell hunting in <ref target="places.html#EustonHall">Euston park</ref> ,!! — My Brothers and Me were affraid to go, But the young Gentlemen Said they knew Mr King the Keeper would Let us hunt, we went, and Just as my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="XXXX">Brother Nat</a> had ascended to the top of the Lofty Oak to dislodge the Squirrel The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="XXXX">Duke and Dutches of Grafton </a> in an Open Carriage and pair of poneys drove up, the Duke immediately ordered us out of the park and Desired us to hunt on our own premises !! </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"> There higmightinesses the Critics have converted the free fields of Genious into A <i>park</i> and have long Usurped the sole propriety thereof to themselves, But it some times happen that the unlearnd poor are sufferd to Enter this <i>Literary park</i>
to hunt for <i>fame</i> and <i>profit</i>. Bob Burns the ploughman and Nan Yearsley the Milk Woman were very successfull, And Jiles the Farmers Boy did wonders!!

Nathaniel Bloomfield’s volume of poems,
<title>An Essay on War</title>, was published in 1803, with a preface by Capel Lofft that revealed the author’s embarrassment about his trade of tailor (‘snip’) (pp. xxv-xxvii). Critics regretted Lofft’s exposure of the author’s embarrassment but declared that Nathaniel’s poems, while exhibiting the recent diffusion of knowledge among the labouring classes, were not good enough for him to give up his trade. See<citee>The Annual Review</cite>, 2 (1803), 585–88, which remarked, ‘The poem being bad, Mr. Capel Lofft is ignorant. Q.E.D, lamentably ignorant, and presumptuously obtrusive in his ignorance’ (p. 587). Cf.<cite>The Monthly Review</cite>, 42 (1803), 379–81. <cite>The British Critic</cite>, 22 (1803), 81–82, declared ‘Another Bloomfield, and a poet! Are all the Bloomfields poets?’ (p. 81). Byron was crueller about labourer poets, and Nathaniel in particular, in <cite>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</cite>
(London, 1809), lines 765–94.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;”> 
When some brisk youth, the tenant of a stall,<br>
Employs a pen less pointed than his awl, <br>
Leaves his snug shop, forsakes his store of shoes, <br>
St. Crispin quits, and cobbles for the muse, <br>
Heavens! how the vulgar stare! how crowds applaud! <br>
How ladies read, and literati laud! <br>
If chance some wicked wag should pass his jest, <br>
‘Tis sheer ill-nature—don’t the world know best? <br>
Genius must guide when wits admire the rhyme, <br>
And Capel Lofft declares ‘tis quite sublime. <br>
Here, then, ye happy sons of needless trade! <br>
Swains! quit the plough, resign the useless spade! <br>
Lo! Burns and Bloomfield, nay, a greater far, <br>
>Gifford was born beneath an adverse star, <br>
Forsook the labours of a servile state, <br>
Stemm’d the rude storm, and triumph’d over fate; <br>
Then why no more? if Phoebus smiled on you, <br>
Bloomfield! why not on brother Nathan too? <br>
Him too the mania, not the muse, has seized; <br>
Not inspiration, but a mind diseased; <br>
And now no boor can seek his last abode,<br>
No common be enclosed without an ode. <br>
Oh! since increased refinement deigns to smile<br>
On Britain’s sons, and bless our genial isle, <br>
Let poesy go forth, pervade the whole, <br>
Alike the rustic, and mechanic soul! <br>
Ye tuneful cobblers! still your notes prolong, <br>
Compose at once a slipper and a song; <br>
So shall the fair your handywork peruse, <br>
Your sonnets sure shall please—perhaps your shoes. <br>
</p>
Byron added a footnote: ‘See Nathaniel Bloomfield’s ode, elegy, or whatever he or any one else chooses to call it, on the enclosure of “Honington Green.”‘ See text of

&c Mankind might be raised to A State of perfection little short of the perfection of Angells, so that War and all the great Evils of humanity would ceace for ever, !!! ——Nat opposed those Utopian notions in beautifull Blank Verse,
<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>An Essay on War</title>
took the grim line argued by Thomas Malthus in
<title>An Essay on the Principle of Population</title>
(1798) against the philosophy of perfectibility advanced by William Godwin in
<title>An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</title>
(1793). Godwin had developed social views about the benefits of rising population; his notion of perfectibility was built upon Enlightenment arguments made by, among others, Immanuel Kant in
<title>Idee zu einer allgemeinem Geschichte</title>
(1784) and Johann Gottfried von Herder in
<title>Ideen</title>
(1784/91). Malthus, and Nathaniel, argued that war was to be welcomed because it relieved poverty by keeping population in check.
</note>
The Critics could not find fault with the Poetry
<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">In fact, many critics did find fault with the versification: see note 4 above. </note>
so they seized the
<hi rend="ital">augument</hi>
, Yet if ever Augument had Reason, common Sense, and Scripture
<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">St James C4th V 1st [Bloomfield’s footnote]. George refers to James 4.1: ‘From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?’ </note>
on its side it is Snips argument, But the Critics cried him down!! Where then said they is Mans

</note>
In short they soon sent poor Snip packing out of their park, This new Scheme of
<hi rend="ital">perfection</hi>
was call’d
<hi rend="ital">the new Light</hi>
hence sprang The
<title>Rights of Man Age of Reason</title>

<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
This derogatory term appeared in
<title>The Annual Review</title>
, 2 (1803), 585–88, which called Lofft ‘mistaken’ in supposing he had ‘found a nest of poets’ (p. 587).

My Brother

was A Sinner in Rhyme, but never dared to Enter their park!!——poor old Crispin made his Lowest, most humble Bow, and Crawld into their park on his hands and knees,!!
<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">
St Crispin is the patron saint of shoemakers, so ‘Crispin’ means a shoemaker: here George refers to himself and his own poems, published late in life in pamphlet form with the aid of local gentlemen who wished to relieve his poverty:
<ref target="../HTML/thetford.html">
<title>Thetford Chalybeate Spa. A Poem by a Parishioner of St. Peters</title>

(1820) and

<title>Friendly Hints Affectionately Addressed, by an Old Man to the Labouring Poor of Suffolk and Norfolk</title>

(1822). See Letters 339a, 360a, 412 and 423.

And is when arrived on the side of the grave Haild by

<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">
A sarcastic reference to George’s brother Robert who, offended by what he saw as George’s toadying to Lofft, as well as ill and depressed, let their correspondence lapse until on 18 July 1820 he sent George a letter complimenting him on
<ref target="../HTML/thetford.html">
<title>Thetford Chalybeate Spa</title>

and hailing him as ‘brother bard’ (Letter 348).

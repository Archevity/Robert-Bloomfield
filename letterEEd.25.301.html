                        Bloomfield</a>, 18 March 1816<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Shefford. March 18. 1816</p><p class="pnonident">My Dear life</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Yours gave me and all of us great pleasure. I am rejoiced to find
                    that you are coming home, even for a little while. We will make the most of it I
                    warrant you, you shall go to bed every night with a sore throat from talking,
                    and get up in the morning and dread your days work: but how, my Soul will you
                    get home? how stands your cash? you cannot have enough surely to get home either
                    way? And it so happens that I have no supply for you, I have only a £60 Bill,
                    not due till the middle of the summer! unfortunate. to get ready money now seems as impossible as to dig Diamonds. But I advise
                    you—do not start,—to state your case, or rather mine, to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LockwoodEdward" title="Mrs Lockwood">Mrs Lockwood</a>, or <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BirdIsaac" title="Mr Bird">Mr Bird</a>. If either will furnish you
                    with two or three pounds I will pay them with the first money that comes into my
                    hands. If you have enough to get to London with, borrow half a guinea there to
                    come down to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a> with, for you may
                    ride to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a> for 8s outside, as we
                    have extra coaches, and a grand opposition. You will see by this that I have no
                    hope of meeting you at Cambridge. There is a Coach lately established which runs
                    from Cambridge to Oxford, and passes through Bedford &amp;c, but even with
                    this you must, I apprehend, sleep a night at Cambridge and be merely set down at
                    Bedford where somebody must meet you. You know how gladly I would meet you if I
                    could, but besides the complaint in my pocket, I have others which I must in
                    justice inform you of.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> For some weeks past I had been troubled with an incessant
                    sickness at the stomach which would neither take or keep food, and soon after
                    came on an inflammation in the right leg, which completely lamed me for many
                    days. I applied to Gaye yesterday week, and he has cured the leg by consistent
                    soaking of rags dipt in a cold Lotion, it is now perfect again, only braced with
                    a 4 yard bandage, or roller. I have likewise taken some internal medicine which
                    makes me eat heartily, and I expect to be quite well very soon; yet you will see
                    that to ride or to walk too much just now would be imprudent, to say the least
                    of it. Let this likewise stand for my excuse for not visiting <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a>; but how shall I sufficiently
                    thank <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LockwoodEdward" title="Mr &amp; Mrs Lockwood">Mr &amp; Mrs Lockwood</a>
                    for their kind and lasting friendship to you and myself? I hope <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LockwoodEdward" title="Mr Lockwood">Mr Lockwood</a> is better than when
                    you wrote last. I have got into a thick correspondence occasiond by the Suffolk
                    Gents endeavouring to do me good,<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> but it is impossible to give you
                    knowledge of the matter by letter. Come and talk with me, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Weston">Weston</a> is gone, [illegible deleted
                    words]—Take notice, I expect a letter on <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sunday morning</em> to
                    say when you start for London, and all about it, be precise, but not
                    precipitate, in all you do; and write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Uncle Nat">Uncle Nat</a> that they may meet you at the Bull, They live close by, and
                    go three nights as well as one, if you cannot appoint a certain day. I shall write to London tomorrow and will give them a
                    hint that you are coming &amp;c. Ride inside if you can borrow or steal the
                    money, for March is not to be trusted a moment.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Health and happiness to you now and for ever.</p><p align="right">Your Old Dad.</p><p class="pnonident">How is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldKitty" title="Aunt Kate">Aunt Kate</a>?</p><p class="l"><em>Address: </em><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Miss Bloomfield">Miss Bloomfield</a>, / <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LockwoodEdward" title="Ed Lockwood">Ed Lockwood</a>'s Esq, / nr Angel Hill, / <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a>, / Sfk<br xmlns=""/></p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add.

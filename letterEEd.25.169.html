A second storm occur'd about two hours after. On my return home, I found <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary">Mary</a> had been sadly frighten'd and she and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> had been crying; they had heard thunder of an uncommon kind, just over their heads but had not learnd what I learnd on coming home to the Milk house, that the lightning had struck through the Roof and floors of the unfinishd house, the third from Doe's yard, and exactly opposite Mr. Franklin's door, which is not more than sixty yards from ours us! no one was hurt, the shavings which caught fire were extinguis'd by the workmen.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Mr Young">Mr Young</a> seems rejoiced to hear that the size of the joint is somthing diminish'd, as it gives him great hopes indeed: as to the leg wasting he insists upon it to be nothing more than a natural consequence of its being out of action, and that it is no way material; as the same shrinking takes place to a certain degree when a man lays in bed long with a broken leg, both will shrink. He is glad to find you persevere so well, and still recomend the discharge, accompanied with the warm bath twice a week. He does not mention any particular heat in the water, but says that he may sit in the Bath, or Tub, not more than ten minutes at a time. keep a plaster <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">only</em> over his sinew, without the bandage; and on his being dried and dress'd, apply a fresh plaster as soon as possible, which I should think you might carry with you to the Bath, as I understand you will find that sort of accommodation and civility which money will generally procure. I should think he will not be afraid of a tub of warm water, but dont frighten him, if you can avoid it.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;">	I will send you money next week, and we hope to keep your birthday with green peas, and gooseberry pie.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteAunt" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> is not in bed yet, you understand me wrong I meant only that she was making preparation for grumbling.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah's">Hannah's</a> Tulips about which she enquires so particularly bad have turnd out very badly. not one blossom! The hyacinths, set at the same corner never come to flower. The sweet williams, and Venus's looking glass are just going to blossom. Old Pup has destroy'd another Chicken, I wish I could get a place for her.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;">	I met Mr. Fisher, he has not sold his Ship, but sent her again to Newcastle for Coals. The young woman who returnd from Paris, and who liv'd with Mrs Palmer, calld on sunday, she has heard a few days past from Mrs Palmer, who is very well.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;">	I have nothing more to add, but say love to all.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;">	Yours truly</p><p align="right">Robert</p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add.

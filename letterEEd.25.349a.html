<p style="text-align:center">Free Thoughts on the Humours of the <i>chase</i> And the Park</p>
			
<p>In the year <i>1769</i> our Esquire at <a href="places.html#Honington">Honington</a> (aMr Quince <a href="#1"> [1]<a name="back1"> </a>) had a party of <i>Gentlemen</i> Boys at his House On a Visit to Master Quince, the Young Norfords <a href="#2"> [2] <a name="back2"> </a>  from Bury &amp;c,—My Self and Brothers were invited as Mrs Q knew though we were very poor, our Mother took all possible care of our Morals,—The young Gentlemen proposed Squirrell hunting in <a href="places.html#EustonHall">Euston park</a> ,!! — My Brothers and Me were affraid to go, But the young Gentlemen Said they knew Mr King the Keeper would Let us hunt, we went, and Just as my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nathaniel Bloomfield">Brother Nat</a> had ascended to the top of the Lofty Oak to dislodge the Squirrel The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Henry Grafton">Duke and Dutches of Grafton </a> in an Open Carriage and pair of poneys drove up, the Duke immediately ordered us out of the park and Desired us to hunt on our own premises !! </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;"> There higmightinesses the Critics have converted the free fields of Genious into A <i>park</i> and have long Usurped the sole propriety thereof to themselves, But it some times happen that the unlearnd poor are sufferd to Enter this <i>Literary park</i>
to hunt for <i>fame</i> and <i>profit</i>. Bob Burns the ploughman and Nan Yearsley the Milk Woman were very successfull, And Jiles the Farmers Boy did wonders!! <a href="#3"> [3] <a name="back3"> </a>But poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nathaniel Bloomfield">Nat</a> had the same Luck in the <i>Literary park</i> as we had in <i>Euston park</i> was orderd out by the Lords of the Soil!! Poor Snip <a href="#4"> [4] <a name="back4"> </a>
was deemd A <i>poacher</i>!! he saucily enterd the park and Mounted Aloft in <i>Heroics</i> and gave the lie Direct to the new <i>scheme of philosophy</i>!! Tis said that some 40 years ago the frightful brain of A German philosopher found out that by <i>Education </i> &amp;c Mankind might be raised to A State of perfection little short of the perfection of Angells, so that War and all the great Evils of humanity would ceace for ever, !!! ——Nat opposed those Utopian notions in beautifull Blank Verse, <a href="#5"> [5] <a name="back5"> </a>The Critics could not find fault with the Poetry <a href="#6"> [6] <a name="back6"> </a>so they seized the <i>augument</i>, Yet if ever Augument had Reason, common Sense, and Scripture <a href="#7"> [7] <a name="back8"> </a>on its side it is Snips argument, But the Critics cried him down!! Where then said they is Mans <i>free Agency</i>, where his allmost Angelick Mental powers, Virtues &amp;c &amp;c <a href="#8"> [8]<a name="back8"> </a></p>

<p>In short they soon sent poor Snip packing out of their park, This new Scheme of <i>perfection</i> was call’d <i>the new Light</i> hence sprang The <cite>Rights of Man Age of Reason</cite> <a href="#9"> [9]<a name="back9"> </a> &amp;c &amp;c, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofttCapel" title="Capel Lofft">Capel Loffts </a> <i> Nest of poets</i> were markd by the Critics <a href="#10"> [10]<a name="back10"> </a> </p>

<p>My Brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac Bloomfield">Isaac</a> was A Sinner in Rhyme, but never dared to Enter their park!!——poor old Crispin made his Lowest, most humble Bow, and Crawld into their park on his hands and knees,!! <a href="#11"> [11]<a name="back11"> </a></p>

<p>And is when arrived on the side of the grave Haild by <i>Giles</i> as <i>A Brother bard</i> !!!!! ——— <a href="#12"> [12] <a name="back12"> </a></p>

					<p class="letnote2"><a name="4">4  </a>Nathaniel Bloomfield’s volume of poems,<cite>An Essay on War</cite>, was published in 1803, with a preface by Capel Lofft that revealed the author’s embarrassment about his trade of tailor (‘snip’) (pp. xxv-xxvii). Critics regretted Lofft’s exposure of the author’s embarrassment but declared that Nathaniel’s poems, while exhibiting the recent diffusion of knowledge among the labouring classes, were not good enough for him to give up his trade. See<cite>The Annual Review</cite>, 2 (1803), 585–88, which remarked, ‘The poem being bad, Mr. Capel Lofft is ignorant. Q.E.D, lamentably ignorant, and presumptuously obtrusive in his ignorance’ (p. 587). Cf.<cite>The Monthly Review</cite>, 42 (1803), 379–81. <cite>The British Critic</cite>, 22 (1803), 81–82, declared ‘Another Bloomfield, and a poet! Are all the Bloomfields poets?’ (p. 81). Byron was crueller about labourer poets, and Nathaniel in particular, in <cite>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</cite> (London, 1809), lines 765–94.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px;"> 
When some brisk youth, the tenant of a stall,<br>
Employs a pen less pointed than his awl, <br>
Leaves his snug shop, forsakes his store of shoes, <br>
St. Crispin quits, and cobbles for the muse, <br>
Heavens! how the vulgar stare! how crowds applaud! <br>
How ladies read, and literati laud! <br>
If chance some wicked wag should pass his jest, <br>
‘Tis sheer ill-nature—don’t the world know best? <br>
Genius must guide when wits admire the rhyme, <br>
And Capel Lofft declares ‘tis quite sublime. <br>
Here, then, ye happy sons of needless trade! <br>
Swains! quit the plough, resign the useless spade! <br>
Lo! Burns and Bloomfield, nay, a greater far, <br>
>Gifford was born beneath an adverse star, <br>
Forsook the labours of a servile state, <br>
Stemm’d the rude storm, and triumph’d over fate; <br>
Then why no more? if Phoebus smiled on you, <br>
Bloomfield! why not on brother Nathan too? <br>
Him too the mania, not the muse, has seized; <br>
Not inspiration, but a mind diseased; <br>
And now no boor can seek his last abode,<br>
No common be enclosed without an ode. <br>
Oh! since increased refinement deigns to smile<br>
On Britain’s sons, and bless our genial isle, <br>
Let poesy go forth, pervade the whole, <br>
Alike the rustic, and mechanic soul! <br>
Ye tuneful cobblers! still your notes prolong, <br>
Compose at once a slipper and a song; <br>
So shall the fair your handywork peruse, <br>
Your sonnets sure shall please—perhaps your shoes. <br>

Byron added a footnote: ‘See Nathaniel Bloomfield’s ode, elegy, or whatever he or any one else chooses to call it, on the enclosure of “Honington Green.”‘ See text of <a  href="..\BloomfieldPages\NatGeoTexts\elegy.html" title="Elergy Honington Greent" target="_blank">‘Honington Green’</a>.</note> <a href="#back4">BACK</a></p>

Godwin had developed social views about the benefits of rising population; his notion of perfectibility was built upon Enlightenment arguments made by, among others, Immanuel Kant in <cite>Idee zu einer allgemeinem Geschichte</cite> (1784) and Johann Gottfried von Herder in <cite>Ideen</cite> (1784/91). Malthus, and Nathaniel, argued that war was to be welcomed because it relieved poverty by keeping population in check. <a href="#back5">BACK</a></p>

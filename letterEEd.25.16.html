                        Bloomfield</a>, 8 September–6 October    1799 <a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">London. Sepm y. 8<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1799</p><p class="pnonident">Dear George,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am very much in your debt with regard to writing. I received
                    your parcell in June, and am every way gratifiy'd and oblidged by its contents;                    you seem to express so much good will and earnest solicitude about my poetical
                    welfare, that I think it incumbent on me to say a few words on that subject                    first.——</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> You know that I have naturally (in common with the rest of the                     family) an inclination for Music, and that I was formerly a beginer in the   practice of it; and you likewise know that when I am at work I often indulge                     myself in whistling and singing; now if I leave off the practical part of music,  as I have done years ago; and then again can find something to amuse my mind
                    with as much as by singing, or perhaps more; I reckon it but amusement still.
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="My wife">My wife</a> and I agree that
                    during the two years that I was breeding with Giles<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> we got on smoother than before, our girls were both out of  hand, our rest was sound, &amp;c, but it unfortunately happened that by the   time I was brought to Bed with my Boy, my wife was breeding another;! We some    times see a ball of wax with so small a portion of the buoyant quality that it    knows not whither to sink or swim; if you put your finger on it when at the  surface, it will dive deep and be a long time in rising again; so it was with my   Boy <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a>, he dived me    into some debts this time twelvemonth, from which I am not yet free, but I have  great hopes I shall be free by the end of November. It is true we are none of   the shining part of the community. — [three lines deleted] they go to market with the fruit of other people's labour, and then with a double chalk score it    up to their own industry and hard striving; Last midsummer twelfth's month I was  out of debt with respect to rent; I had hired a little house in an alley in Grub  Street, (a bad place for a poet) but being disappointed we continued at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HortonMr" title="Horton's">Horton's</a> a year longer, and a groaning, and a long Winter have thrown us behind; this Sumer <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HortonMr" title="Horton's">Horton's</a> House was going to be repaird,   we left them by consent leaving some rent unpaid, after living there seven years    and a quarter, and paying most part of the time seven pound pr year. — We now      hired on the spot, a dining room, bed room, kitchen, washhouse, nursery,     workshop, &amp;c; that is to say, a large two pair stairs room with two     north windows, and one south, at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MulberryCourt" title="No. 1 Mulbery Court">No. 1     Mulbery Court</a>, our north prospect is terminated by a high range of
                    chimney pots in Coleman Street buildings, but here is a throrough air (cockney                    air) and excellent light. All our endeavours are to get clear, and to live                    happy, and to hope humbly, and thereby blunt the edge of disappointments. —                    perhaps your Wife when she speaks of 'doubts that I should be unsettled' have                    entertaind notions as to the reputation and profit too; to be coming from my                    book, such as never can be realized. If you yourself have doubts of my                    discretion, I know it is from the kindest motives, if it should bring me five                    pound you would be glad to hear that I had made <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="my Wife">my Wife</a> and Children happy.
                    Perhaps after all you only mean, for fear I should slacken my hand now at
                    shoemaking, that I may make poetry the faster; this is a groundless fear: If I                    had leisure hours I should read, but in this I debar myself as much as I
                    possibly can; the only extravagance I have been guilty of in this way is the                    purchase of 2 Numbrs. of the 'Monthly Magazine,' and I am not a little pleased
                    to find <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L">Mr. L</a> a well-known                    correspondent of theirs. ——</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I suspected <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L">Mr. L</a> was
                    concerned in the new Review, from his friend saying (the 'respectable Gentleman
                    in London to whom he had communicated his sentiments respecting the poem') — he
                    says, 'I read that part of your letter to Messrs <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VernorThomas" title="Vernor">Vernor</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Hood">Hood</a>, my publishers,' and in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L's">Mr. L's</a> letter to you he expressed it,
                    our publishers. — </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I thank you for the account of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DyerGeorge" title="Dyer">Dyer</a>.<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> Dr. Johnson, I think, is a 'Thwackum'<a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> amongst criticks; I allways
                    look at him and his abilities with a mixture of reverence and anger. — </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have read Gay's 'Trivia;'<a href="#4"> [4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> it decends to minute
                    descriptions of London, more minute than mine do of the country; his minutia
                    must be more subject to change than mine, less dependant on Nature. — </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> From the many letters I have recieved from you on poetical                    subjects, I find that our taste of those things agrees surprisingly, even to                    little particulars, I can allways, therefore, speak to you with the confidence                    of being understood; and when I find you and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L">Mr. L</a>, use the same high epithets of                    praise for my poetry, I am oblidged to believe you, from knowing and observing                    that though some would read or hear Ramsay's piece<a href="#5"> [5]</a><a name="back5"> </a>                    unmovd, I cannot. — An Ear for Music, and a Voice, are by Nature somtimes given                    jointly, somtimes separately, and more frequently totally withheld. Dr Johnson                    was unmoved by the powers of Music, the 'concord of sweet sounds,'<a href="#6"> [6]</a><a name="back6"> </a> and yet could write musical
                    poetry! If you feel the same pleasure in reading mine which I and you and all of                    us feel in reading other poetry, you have a right to use what expressions you                    please without being accused of flattery. — </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I often thought of 'Hail, May,'<a href="#7"> [7]</a><a name="back7"> </a> and whether <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L">Mr. L</a> would ever see it, and                    determined not to speak of such things till I was forced; but it is now, with
                    its accompanying information, got into his hands; in the best manner it could                    have gone; and though I dont think so highly of it as you seem to do, I am
                    convinced it will do me no hurt. — </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I shall see in what manner the Farmer's Boy is advertised, not in
                    the papers but on the covers of the monthly publications from that house, the                    'Monthly Mirror,' 'Ladies' Museum,' &amp;c. — they insert their
                    advertisements in the Chronicle, &amp;c. — Relative to its ornamental part,                    the Cuts, I send the following from the 'Monthly Magazine.' I write this letter
                    at different opportunities; it is now Oct. ye 6th, and I have lent the magazine                    to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a>, which contains my intended
                    extract. It is to this effect, 'That the art of engraving on Woodden Blocks,                    which formerly constituted the only ornaments for Books; have lately been
                    revived by the "<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BewickThomas" title="Bewicks">Bewicks</a>" of                    Newcastle; one of them is dead, but the art is not dead; for we understand that
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AndersonJohn" title="a son of Dr. Anderson">a son of Dr. Anderson</a>, and
                    several other young men have carried the art to very great perfection; their                    performances rival in brilliancy and spirit the finest productions on copper.
                    Every one acquainted with the trouble and delays of printing with plates of                    Copper is sensible of the advantages and convenience of this way, as the prints
                    are impressed at the same time with the letter-press.'<a href="#8"> [8]</a><a name="back8"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Not long after you left London, Buckler; or, as we called him,                    Buckle, the shoemaker of Pitcher's Court, impertuned me repeatedly to write out                    for him my scraps of poetry which had been inserted in the papers, I did it, and
                    I remember that he approvd most 'an Harvest scene', in blank verse; but this,                    and all the rest, but that which you have sent to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L">Mr. L</a>, I have forgot, and if you have
                    any more by you should be particularly oblig'd to you if you will put your thumb                    upon them and not let them see the daylight again. Buckle was a poetical
                    enthusiast, he went to America, and I heard that he carried on a roaring trade                    at New York, but broke during the first visitation of the fever, wrote to
                    Charles Jones since, that he was going to purchase land in the back settlements                    and turn farmer, since which, accounts have come that he is dead, and left a
                    Wife and 2 or 3 children.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DillyCharles" title="Mr. Dilly's">Mr. Dilly's</a> is nearly opposite to
                    Vernor and Hoods, (perhaps he will rather wonder how I came by the patronage of                    a critick,) the name of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VernorThomas" title="Vernor">Vernor</a> you
                    may perhaps remember in Fore Stt, Between the Castle and the end of Coleman Stt,                    when we lived at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SimmsMr" title="Syms's">Syms's</a>; he was here
                    only a Bookseller; he moved to Birchin Lane and opend a Circulating Library, and                    I afterwards found the name of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Hood">Hood</a>
                    added to his; from hence they moved to their present situation and became                    publishers; but I see nothing of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VernorThomas" title="Mr Vernor">Mr
                        Vernor</a>. I imagine him to be old, for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> is the acting partner — he
                    seems about 40, and with what we call a gentlemanlike carriage; he seems                    naturally good-naturd, and perhaps would have told me more particulars if I had
                    found heart enuff to ask them. I doubt we shall never know who the 'Respectable                    Gentleman' is, to whom <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L">Mr. L</a> wrote
                    his first sentiments of the poem; I judge it was the same Gentleman who borrowed                    it to read before it went to the designer and engraver, &amp;c. — <a href="#9"> [9]</a><a name="back9"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> You may perhaps sometimes wish to know whither when it comes out                    it will be a sudden surprise to my London acquaintance, or whether they know it
                    allready? you may remember I told you that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> told me to call again in a month and I should see some of it
                    printed; this was last February. — as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HortonMr" title="Horton">Horton</a> and my shopmates did not recon me close and uncommunicative, I
                    did not like that they should; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="my wife">my                        wife</a> and I consulted about it, that as it was to come so soon, we had
                    Better tell them now, and not let them say we were close &amp;c., and                    perhaps more, that I wanted to cut the greater shine over them; I therefore told
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HortonMr" title="Horton">Horton</a>, and he carried it to the                    Blew Last, and I soon found myself obliged to explain to Robinson, &amp;c.,
                    but, as it has been detaind so long, I have often repented of devulging it at                    all, as it is, I must take all that follows. — </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> If the piece is really ever so intrinsically good, and my
                    reputation raised by it to public notice, there are thousands who would still
                    cry 'what do he get by it' to these 'lovers of gain,' gain is the sum total of
                    all other arguments and considerations. To silence those it is no small triumph
                    to me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L">Mr. L</a> has ensured to me
                    half the profits, if profits should arise from it; and if no profits arise, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr. Hood">Mr. Hood</a> will make a worse job of it
                    than I. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> It must be obvious to you what a great advantage we gaind, or
                    rather you gaind, by showing the book to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. L">Mr. L</a>. As every book applys itself more or less to the experience and
                    judgment of its readers, so does this, perhaps neither <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BentWilliam" title="Mr Bent">Mr Bent</a> nor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DillyCharles" title="Mr Dilly">Mr Dilly</a> ever saw a spring morning

                    on 'Originality of composition' comparing it with music, and other things, but I
                    shall never find time I doubt to do it, — I sometimes think of a criticism and
                    remarks on some well known songs, &amp;c. proverbial sayings &amp;c at
                    other times I think if you and I was to keep a journal of the weather we might

                        and rural scenes their speciality. The Bewicks illustrated editions of poems by Gay and by Goldsmith. Bloomfield admired Thomas's <cite>A General History of Quadrupeds</cite> (Newcastle upon Tyne, 1790). Here, Bloomfield is quoting <cite>The Monthly Magazine</cite>, 8.2     (September 1799). <cite>The Farmer's Boy</cite> was first     published with woodcuts by Thomas Bewick's former apprentice John Anderson    (1775–?).

                    down to write to you. I am tolarably happy and more than tolarably busy. I have
                    had a complimentary letter sent me from a Mr Swinburne of Leicester he was much
                    pleased with my description of our cheese, his letter did not come alone there
                    came with it a Leicester Cheese of 11lb. — Last night I had a letter enclosing a
                    £2 note from a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GilchristOctavius" title="Mr Gilchrist">Mr Gilchrist</a> of
                    Stamford. If Mr Burrell of Cambridge would send me some more Tobacco I might
                    live cheap these hard times, and smoke a health to all my friends. TWO things I
                    wish you would not forget when you send, 1<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup> the Letters for

                    affairs as I could wish. I will write to him soon. The Boot patterns I had from

                    in the high taste. I have a cold coming, and my head akes, or I would send
                    patterns of my Womans Work. I have a man and a half employd now, and have plenty
                    of good custom lookd out. I like it Better than I did. So much for my mastering.
                    My book affairs go on tolarably. I am getting acquainted with another baronet,

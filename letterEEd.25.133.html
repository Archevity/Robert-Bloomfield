So much for the journey.—I dare not speak on politicks as I could wish because it is such an endless subject, but certainly after seeing in the french people that wonderful attatchment to Monarchy and to Monarchs, which as a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">national and characteristic</em> foible, (so it was call'd) excited the ridicule of Smollet<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> and most English writers; and latterly seeing them so vehemently attatched to the Hero of Marengo;<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> the Consulship, and the Emperorship have not at all surprized me. It is an old trick of theirs, the pendelum has been to its length and is returning.—and though the making an Emperor, and <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">then</em> asking the people to vote, be the quintessence of a political joke, I belive less of the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">possibility</em> of the operation of fear and force than many do, and believe that an astonishing power arises for him in the pride of military France, in the blaze of his enterprizing mind, and his unpresidented victories. Therefore he is formidable. I had a long letter the other day from Mrs Palmer at paris, but not a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Word of Politicks</em>!! She acts very prudently, and I may see her again.—I still think that the general system of instruction, and the downfall of the feudal rights of families, with the present religious toleration &amp;c are fruits of the revolution not to be despised; and though I long thought, and still think that the Bourbons are likely to have the power again, I care less about <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">them</em> and <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">the new Emperor</em> than I ever did in my life. all my desire of the french is that they would keep at home, and I trust they are strong enough to destroy any thing we could send to their coast to molest them <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">there</em>.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;">	Perhaps <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PittWilliam" title="Pit">Pit</a> may turn out to be Sampson with his head shorn, perhaps the good old king may resign his power, and then perhaps proposals for peace. I should like to gossip with you face to face about these perhapses, and more particularly on the subject of englands boast 'the liberty of the press.' I think two pints of Ale would make us talk very wisely on this head, and endeavour to find whither we have any thing to boast of or not.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;">	I am going for a day or two about 14 miles from Town to visit a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpMrs" title="Mrs Sharp">Mrs Sharp</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="her daughter">her daughter</a>, (relations of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpWilliam" title="Surgeon Sharp">Surgeon Sharp</a>) they live at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ClareHall" title="Clare Hall">Clare Hall</a>, near South Mims in Hertfordshire.

                    Father has told you, and I have a mortal objection to seeing anything in the shape of a letter with so much blank space as there
                    would have been in this, but for the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">sense</em> which <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I</em> am now putting into it, and another
                    reason, my Father has not said <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">all</em> he intended, he wishes you, when next you write, to say what you gave for
                    the spectacles that he may give you the money for them (when he gets it) or pay you when he comes to Town. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> would <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">write</em> to you his thoughts, but he has two

                    thinking it one of his best. I herewith return you <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MooreThomas" title="Moores">Moores</a> Book<a href="#4"> [4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> with thanks for the pleasure it has given me, I have marked with pencil those

                    condemn or applaud my taste, as in your judgement seemeth meet—if you have the other volume (for this I see is the second) will
                    you let it me? Make haste and win your 1/16th of 30000.—You say I have said nothing about coming to town—very true, but I am far
                    even thinking about it,—for time, even at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>, never hung so heavily as now. I
                    verily think it stands right still sometimes,—and yet, so inconsistent am I, that I shall regret to leave the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">place</em>, although for want of that sort of society that I could enjoy, I can never considder it as a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">home</em>—but I tormented you with this stuff when you was here—My father will be in town he thinks in about a month, but he
                    must stay till he has done his poems, which now with the assistance of the new spectacles he hopes to be able to complete soon; at
                    all events he <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">must</em> be in town before Michaelmass to find some hole to put our heads in, but now I must, I
                    fear, stay here till such hole is found. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Chas'">Chas'</a> is dull from want of

                    glad to find by your letter to father that your situation is less irksome than formerly, the worst part of your information is the
                    fluctuating state of your health, I wish I could send you a little Bedfordshire air, and two or three wheatfields for your private
                    enjoyment, for such a treat is too good for the groveling—body's (I was going to say <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">souls</em>) that surround
                    you. Our scenery will soon be embellish'd by Irish reapers for 'sure' a great number of them have been here for this

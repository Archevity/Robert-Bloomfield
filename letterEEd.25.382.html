                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Joseph Weston">Joseph Weston</a>, 17 April 1824<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">12, Providence-row, Finsbury-square, </p><p align="right">April 17, 1824</p>
						<p class="pnonident">Dear Sir</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I received your letter last Monday, and carried to the     booksellers that addressed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Mr Baldwin">Mr   Baldwin</a>, but was not fortunate enough to find him at home. I trust you    have by this time had a reply from him, and I feel very anxious to know its    complexion, I took a copy of yours (to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Mr. Baldwin">Mr. Baldwin</a>), and sent it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="my mother">my mother</a>, and, besides,  explained as well as I could the nature of the advice you have given, I received  from her the enclosed, containing also <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Mr. Inskip's">Mr. Inskip's</a> concurrence, I don't know whether the accounts of  Messrs. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Baldwin">Baldwin</a> and Co. may be any way useful to you, to examine at your leisure; but I felt sorry, after you were   gone, that you did not take them with you. I therefore send them, and also three   letters relative to the cottage at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a>;—that from Mr. Golding (the attorney employed by the   purchaser) is the one to which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Mr. Inskip">Mr.  Inskip</a> has alluded, which is the best reason I have for sending them,            for it seems a useless intrusion to worry our friends on so hopeless a subject.   The question about the <em>Biography</em> which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Mr. Inskip">Mr. Inskip</a> asks will be      unintelligible, without my saying, that if you had been likely to be stationary   and at leisure, I had an intention of asking you to become Biographer, in case     you found (on examination) sufficient materials for the purpose. I have not   consulted Mr. Harvey; perhaps <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Mr. Baldwin's">Mr.     Baldwin's</a> reply will enable you to judge whether it will be desirable  or useful. I omitted to tell you that I had written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Mr. Park">Mr. Park</a> for his advice and opinion,
                    as to the propriety of parting with the half-copyrights;—and the value of them.
                    I briefly described the circumstances in which we are placed; he returned the
                    answer which I here send. I trouble you with all these papers not because I
                    think them very important, but that I think you ought to know what has been
                    done, or omitted. I am quite aware of the necessity for our (for <em>my</em>) personal exertion for our future support, and am resolved to <em>try</em> my utmost, when once clear of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>, and would do so, if the                  necessity were not so urgent; but, till we <em>are</em> clear, I    cannot give you proof of my sincerity. I shall wait anxiously for your next.  Pray remember me kindly to Miss Weston, and believe me,</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Dear Sir, yours truly,</p>

					<p class="pnonident"><span xmlns="" id="index.xml-label-N18701CB"><!--anchor--></span>P.S. I think I have before informed you, that my father has        repeatedly expressed a wish that either <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Mr. Park">Mr. Park</a> or yourself would write his Biography, if it should ever    be required. I asked <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Mr. Park">Mr. Park</a>,     who declined it, as being already engaged in a similar employment, and    recommended an application to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobert" title="Mr. Southey">Mr.     Southey</a>, or <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RogersSamuel" title="Mr. Rogers">Mr.  Rogers</a>. We declined asking either of those gentlemen, supposing   them to be so engaged in more important concerns as not to be likely to   undertake it.</p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">

Robert Bloomfield to Joseph Banfield, 1 May
                        1804<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shepherd" title="Shepherd &amp; Shepherdess">Shepherd &amp; Shepherdess</a>, City Road, London. May 1, 1804</p><p class="pnonident">Sir</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I feel very much relieved myself since receiving your kind and
                    sensible letter. I had formed to myself a picture of the party who wrote under
                    the signiture of B. C. which I am very agreeably surprised to find wrong. I had
                    conceived the writer to be perhaps himself in search of preferment in the Navy,
                    and having probably no very honourable intentions as to the family of the
                    officer lately deceased; and I wrote in the moment of irritation what perhaps
                    more sober reflection would have condemn'd; I wrote as I felt. After this
                    apology on my part, I beg you will assure the young man that I send back his
                    letter with much pleasure to myself, and an high opinion of your candour and
                    interest in his behalf. Tell him by no means to despair of success in the
                    persuit of poetry; but let him exert his faculties under the guardianship of
                    moral Truth, and a conscientious regard for his own character, and then there is
                    no great fear of offending, but certainly great hopes of the contrary. Tell him
                    Sir, that I can have no possible claim whatever on the present he encloses. I
                    would much rather give him my hand if I could reach him. I have five young
                    children of my own, and I trust I have a Father's feelings too. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am much pleased with so fair an understanding in this little
                    business, and certainly shall not by any means give an unpleasant sensation to
                    your young friend by making mention of what I am sure he will hereafter see to
                    have been improper as to himself, and rather hard of digestion on my part.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> With many thanks Sir, for your letter, and Respects to both, I of
                    course return the Note; which you will not understand but with the sincerest
                    regard to justice and the most obvious fulfillment of common civility. I have no
                    claim on your friend; but feel gratified and entirely at ease from your
                    communication.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Remaining, sir, your Obed, Humble Servant,</p><p align="right">Robt Bloomfield</p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add.

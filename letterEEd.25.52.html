                        1801<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Sunday Afternoon, April 19th, 1801.</p><p class="pnonident">Dear George,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I forgot to indorse the Bill untill after it was gone, and so made a botch of it. I have no immediate convenience
                    of cashing it here, so send it again to you. I yesterday sought after purple trimings at the warehouse where they are made, but it
                    happen'd unfortunately they had none of that colour of any kind I then search'd the shoemakers' windows, but could find every sort
                    but the right. I was too poorly to walk far, so reluctantly gave it up, I know not what you must say to your customers but a
                    quill'd Riband White, or a white Rose is very common for that colour, and looks well. I could not see after your skins till
                    further leisure. I send you ½ Dozn of shoes for your window (if you think propper), We will recon them at 4s 9d pr pair, one with
                    the other. They will require to be put on a last to bring them into shape. Send me the £30 pound as soon as possible. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> was here this morning, they are all well but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldJames" title="James">James</a>, who has got the whooping cough, their shop promise very fair for trade, I
                    hope it will do. Yesterday in consequence of my letter to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Duke">Duke</a> the
                    preceeding day, a servant mounted brought me a kind letter from his Grace with his approbation of Walter and Jane.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> The servant took an answer back, and I must call there on Wednesday next. This blacksmith
                    and his doxy being the last of my family (in the poetical line), I feel my mind much eased, as well as much gratified by finding
                    the critics smile upon the young rogues. As to my health, I was right, I hop'd and trusted that the Doctor could draw of the
                    water; this he has done, and is doing, but not without weakening me much. I shall soon be well if I continue to mend as I have
                    done the last three days. My breathing is easy, and the swelling gone.</p><p class="indent2"> Love to all friends,</p><p align="right">Robert</p><p class="pnonident">The Georgicks with all its beauties is allmost a bawdy story — I will soon send you Wordsworth's poems, if there is no poetry
                        in them I will give up my pretension to feeling and Nature.<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> I can trust you I think to be struck with them, first with their extreem simplicity, and then
                        for what I before mentioned, NATURE.</p></div>

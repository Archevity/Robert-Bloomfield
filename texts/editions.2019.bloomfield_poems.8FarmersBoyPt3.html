          <div class="indent4 ">And, as revolving Seasons chang&rsquo;d the scene</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">The woodcock and the painted pheasant race,</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">There his first thoughts to Nature&rsquo;s charms inclin&rsquo;d,<span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">That stamps devotion on th&rsquo;inquiring mind.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">A little farm his generous Master till&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Who with peculiar grace his station fill&rsquo;d;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">By deeds of hospitality endear&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Serv&rsquo;d from affection, for his worth rever&rsquo;d:<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">A happy offspring blest his plenteous board,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">His fields were fruitful, and his barns well stor&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And fourscore ewes he fed, a sturdy team,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And lowing kine that grazed beside the stream:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Unceasing industry he kept in view;<span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And never lack&rsquo;d a job for Giles to do.</div>
          <div class="indent5 ">Fled now the sullen murmurs of the North,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The splendid raiment of the Spring peeps forth;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Her universal green, and the clear sky,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Delight still more and more the gazing eye.<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Wide o&rsquo;er the fields, in rising moisture strong,</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">Assume <a href="#12">[12]</a><a name="12back">&nbsp;</a> a livery of sober brown:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Again disturb&rsquo;d, when Giles with wearying strides</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">From ridge to ridge the ponderous harrow guides;<span class="lineNumber">80</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">His heels deep sinking every step he goes,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Till dirt usurp the empire of his <a href="#13">[13]</a><a name="13back">&nbsp;</a> shoes.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Welcome green headland! firm beneath his feet;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Welcome the friendly bank&rsquo;s refreshing seat!</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">There, warm with toil, his panting horses browse<span class="lineNumber">85</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Their shelt&rsquo;ring canopy of pendent boughs,</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">Yet oft the sculking gunner by surprise</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Will scatter death amongst them as they rise.<span class="lineNumber">110</span></div>

          <div class="indent4 ">In the mid air, while circling round and round,</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">With quick&rsquo;ning wing, and notes of loud alarm,</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">Yet never fam&rsquo;d was he nor foremost found</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To break the seal of sleep; his sleep was sound:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But when at day-break summon&rsquo;d from his bed,</div>

              Capel Lofft (absent in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Poems [Stereotype]</span>):] In these verses, which have much of picturesque, there is a severe charge
              against <em xmlns="">Rooks</em> and <em xmlns="">Crows</em>, as very formidable depredators; and their destruction, as such, seems
              to be recommended. Such was the prevalent opinion some years back. It is less general now: and I am sure the humanity of the Author, and
              his benevolence to Animals in general, will dispose him to rejoice in whatever plea can be offered in stay of execution of this
              sentence. And yet more so, if it shall appear that <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Rooks</span>, at least, deserve not only mercy, but <em xmlns="">protection</em> and <em xmlns="">encouragement</em> from the Farmer.</p>
			  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class=" ">I shall quote a passage from <a class="link_ref" type="m" href="../people.html#BewickThomas" title="Bewick&rsquo;s"><span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Bewick&rsquo;s</span></a>
              interesting <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">History</span> of <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Birds</span>: the narrative part of which is often as full of information
              as the embellishments cut in wood are beautiful&hellip; It is this.</p>
			  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class=" ">Speaking of Birds of the <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Pie-kind</span> in general, he
                says &lsquo;Birds of this kind [p. 63] are found in every part of the known world, from Greenland to the Cape of Good Hope. In many respects                they may be said to be of singular benefit to mankind: principally by destroying great quantities of noxious insects, worms, and                reptiles. <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Rooks</span>, in particular, are fond of the eruc&aelig; of <em xmlns="">the hedge-chaffer, </em>or chesnut <em xmlns="">brown beetles </em>for which they search with indefatigable pains. These insects,&rsquo; he adds in a note, &lsquo;appear in hot
                weather in formidable numbers: disrobing the fields and trees of their verdure, blossoms, and fruit; spreading desolation and                destruction wherever they go&hellip;They appeared in great numbers in <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Ireland</span> during a hot summer, and committed great                ravages. In the year 1747 whole meadows and corn-fields were destroyed by them in <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Suffolk</span>. The decrease of                Rookeries in that County was thought to be the occasion of it. The many Rookeries with us is in some measure the reason why we have so                few of these destructive animals.&rsquo; [Wallis&rsquo;s History of Northumberland.]</p>
              <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class=" ">&lsquo;Rooks,&rsquo; he subjoins, &lsquo;are often accus&rsquo;d of feeding on the corn just after it has been sown, and various contrivances have been made
                both to kill and frighten them away; but, in our estimation, the advantages deriv&rsquo;d from the destruction which they make among grubs,                earth-worms, and noxious insects of various kinds, will greatly overpay the injury done to the future harvest by the small quantity of                corn they may destroy in searching after their favourite food&rsquo;. [Lofft further notes:] Mr. Bewick does not seem to have been quite                aware that much of the mischief, as I have been informed by a sensible neighbouring Farmer and Tenant, is done in the grub-state of                the chaffer by biting through the <em xmlns="">roots </em>of grass, &amp;c. A latent, and imperceptibly, but rapidly spreading                mischief, against which the <em xmlns="">rooks </em>and birds of similar instinct are, in a manner, the sole protection. C. L.]</p>

                are a clamorous race: mostly build in trees, and form a kind of society in which there appears something like a regular government. A
                Centinel watches for the general safety, and gives notice on the appearance of danger.&rsquo;</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class=" ">Under the Title, &lsquo;<span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Rooks</span>,&rsquo; (p. 71) Mr. <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Bewick</span> repeats his observations on the useful property of this Bird.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class=" ">I

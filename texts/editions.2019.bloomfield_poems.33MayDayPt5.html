		 <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 "><span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">I had</span> folded my flock, and my heart was o&rsquo;erflowing,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I loiter&rsquo;d beside the small lake on the heath;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The red sun, though down, left his drapery glowing,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And no sound was stirring, I heard not a breath:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I sat on the turf, but I meant not to sleep, <span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And gazed o&rsquo;er that lake which for ever is new,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Where clouds over clouds appear&rsquo;d anxious to peep</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">From this bright double sky with its pearl and its blue.</div>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Forgetfulness, rather than slumber, it seem&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">When in infinite thousands the fairies arose<span class="lineNumber">10</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">All over the heath, and their tiny crests gleam&rsquo;d</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">In mock&rsquo;ry of soldiers, our friends and our foes.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">There a stripling went forth, half a finger&rsquo;s length high,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And led a huge host to the north with a dash;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Silver birds upon poles went before their wild cry, <span class="lineNumber">15</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">While the monarch look&rsquo;d forward, adjusting his sash.</div>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Soon after a terrible bonfire was seen,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The dwellings of fairies went down in their ire,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But from all I remember, I never could glean</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Why the woodstack was burnt, or who set it on fire.<span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The flames seem&rsquo;d to rise o&rsquo;er a deluge of snow,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">That buried its thousands,&mdash;the rest ran away;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For the hero had here overstrain&rsquo;d his long bow,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Yet he honestly own&rsquo;d the mishap of the day.</div>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Then the fays of the north like a hailstorm came on, <span class="lineNumber">25</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And follow&rsquo;d him down to the lake in a riot,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Where they found a large stone which they fix&rsquo;d him upon,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And threaten&rsquo;d, and coax&rsquo;d him, and bade him be quiet.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">He that conquer&rsquo;d them all, was to conquer no more,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But the million beheld he could conquer alone;<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">After resting awhile, he leap&rsquo;d boldly on shore,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">When away ran a fay that had mounted his throne.</div>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">&rsquo;Twas pleasant to see how they stared, how they scamper&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">By furze-bush, by fern, by no obstacle stay&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And the few that held council, were terribly hamper&rsquo;d, <span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For some were vindictive, and some were afraid.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I saw they were dress&rsquo;d for a masquerade train,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Colour&rsquo;d rags upon sticks they all brandish&rsquo;d in view,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And of such idle things they seem&rsquo;d mightily vain,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Though they nothing display&rsquo;d but a bird split in two.<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Then out rush&rsquo;d the stripling in battle array,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And both sides determined to fight and to maul:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Death rattled his jawbones to see such a fray,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And glory personified laugh&rsquo;d at them all.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Here he fail&rsquo;d,&mdash;hence he fled, with a few for his sake, <span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And leap&rsquo;d into a cockle-shell floating hard by;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">It sail&rsquo;d to an isle in the midst of the lake,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Where they mock&rsquo;d fallen greatness, and left him to die.</div>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Meanwhile the north fairies stood round in a ring,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Supporting his rival on guns and on spears,<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Who, though not a soldier, was robed like a king;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Yet some were exulting, and some were in tears.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">A lily triumphantly floated above,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The crowd press&rsquo;d, and wrangling was heard through the whole;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Some soldiers look&rsquo;d surly, some citizens strove <span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To hoist the old nightcap on liberty&rsquo;s pole.</div>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">But methought in my dream some bewail&rsquo;d him that fell,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And liked not his victors so gallant, so clever,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Till a fairy stepp&rsquo;d forward, and blew through a shell,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Bear misfortune with firmness, you&rsquo;ll triumph for ever.&rsquo;<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I woke at the sound, all in silence, alone,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The moor-hens were floating like specks on a glass,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The dun clouds were spreading, the vision was gone,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And my dog scamper&rsquo;d round &rsquo;midst the dew on the grass.</div>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">I took up my staff, as a knight would his lance, <span class="lineNumber">65</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s my sceptre, my baton, my spear,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And there&rsquo;s my prime minister far in advance,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Who serves me with truth for his food by the year.&rsquo;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">So I slept without care till the dawning of day,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Then trimm&rsquo;d up my woodbines and whistled amain;<span class="lineNumber">70</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">My minister heard as he bounded away,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And we led forth our sheep to their pastures again.</div>

            <div class="indent4 ">Those toils still lengthen&rsquo;d when he reach&rsquo;d that shore </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Where Spain&rsquo;s bright mountains heard the cannons roar,</div>

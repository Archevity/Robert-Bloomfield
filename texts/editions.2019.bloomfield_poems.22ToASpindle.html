        <p class="indent0 ">[Brayley&rsquo;s note:]  <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Bloomfield</span> has favoured us with permission to copy the annexed portrait of his mother from a picture in   his possession, and has himself subjoined the following account of the last stage of her life, together with his first essay in Blank verse,  which he has addressed to the <em xmlns="">Spindle </em>that she left <em xmlns="">half filled</em>.</p>
        <p class="indent0 ">[Bloomfield&rsquo;s note:] The portrait of my mother was taken on her last visit to London, in the summer of 1804, and about six   months previous to her dissolution. During the period of evident decline in her strength and faculties, she conceived, in place of that  patient resignation which she had before felt, an ungovernable dread of ultimate want, and observed to a relative, with peculiar emphasis, that &lsquo;to meet  <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Winter, Old Age</span>, and  <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Poverty</span>, was like meeting three giants.&rsquo;</p>
        <p class="indent0 ">To the last hour of her life she was an excellent spinner; and latterly, the peculiar kind of wool she spun, was brought  exclusively for her, as being the only one in the village, who exercised their industry on so fine a sort. During the tearful paroxysms of   her last depression she spun with the utmost violence, and with vehemence exclaimed &mdash;&lsquo;<em xmlns="">I must spin!</em>&rsquo; A paralytic   affection, struck her whole right side, while at work, and obliged her to quit her spindle when only half filled, and she died within a   fortnight afterwards! I have that spindle now. She was buried on the last day of the year 1804. She returned from her visit to London, on  Friday, the 29th of June, just to a day, twenty-three years after she brought me to London, which was also on a Friday, in the year  1781.</p>

          <div class="indent3 ">Relic! I will not bow to thee, nor worship! </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">Yet, treasure as thou art, remembrancer </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">Of sunny days, that ever haunt my dreams, </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">Where thy brown fellows as a task I twirl&rsquo;d, </div>

          <div class="indent3 ">The seat of life, and terrors fill&rsquo;d her brain;</div>

          <div class="indent3 "> <span class="smallcaps">Winter, Old Age</span>, and  <span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Poverty</span>, all came:</div>

          <div class="indent3 ">Cried, &lsquo;<em>Spin no more</em>;&rsquo; thou then wert left half fill&rsquo;d </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">With this soft downy fleece, such as she wound</div>
          <div class="indent3 ">Through all her days! She who could spin so well!</div>
          <div class="indent3 ">Half fill&rsquo;d wert thou, half finish&rsquo;d when she died.</div>

          <div class="indent3 ">We spin vain threads, and dream, <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="1back">&nbsp;</a> and strive, and die </div>

            hands!</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Then feeling, as I do, resistlessly,</div>
          <div class="indent3 ">The bias set upon my soul for verse;</div>
          <div class="indent3 ">Oh! should old age still find my brain at work,<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
          <div class="indent3 ">And Death o&rsquo;er some poor fragment striding, cry, </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">&lsquo;Hold! spin no more.&rsquo; Grant Heav&rsquo;n, that purity </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">Of thought and texture, may assimilate </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">That fragment unto thee, in usefulness, </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">In worth, and snowy innocence. Then shall <span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
          <div class="indent3 ">The Village school-mistress, shine brighter, though <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="3back">&nbsp;</a></div>
          <div class="indent3 ">The exit of her boy; and both shall live, </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">And virtue triumph too, and virtue&rsquo;s tears, </div>
          <div class="indent3 ">Like Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s pure blessings, fall upon their grave.</div>
        </div>
        <p class="indent0 ">[Brydges&rsquo; critical summary:] There is no reader of English poetry, who does not recollect Cowper&rsquo;s exquisite lines on his  Mother&rsquo;s Picture. This fragment of Bloomfield forms a noble companion to them. It strikes me to be written in a loftier tone, and still more  excellent manner than any of his other productions. Let him give new delight and astonishment to the world by a moral and descriptive poem in blank verse!</p>

		<h3>Anecdotes and Observations, Reflections and Critical Remarks <a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;">March 12th, 1801. — About sixteen years ago, a relation (who I think had a daughter) of Daniel de 	Foe, the author of Crusoe, lived in Broker Row, Moorfields. He was an old man, and kept a small shoemaker's shop, and had done 		many years; but I am not quite sure that the relationship was on <em>his</em> side; it might be on his wife's. </p>

			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The notices commonly put upon walls, for bill-stickers to read and tremble, are generally worded with a threat of their being prosecuted, &amp;c. I noticed a board affixed to the Tabernacle of G. Whitfield, <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> worded thus — 'Please to take notice, if any Bills are put against this building, they will immediately be taken down.'</p>

			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Providence has a very difficult task to please the creature MAN; the latter neglects his proper avocation, Agriculture, to go in search of black eyes and bloody noses, commonly called military glory, and then blames his Maker for not sending him a proper supply of food. — <cite>Publican's Newspaper</cite>. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a></p>

			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I think a small kind of carriage to hold one person might be made to go on the ice with great velocity, if the whole strength of the rider could be exerted for that purpose. By the help of a sharp spike, or a pole with three or more spikes, 		to strike or lay hold on the ice, a great weight might be put in motion. Perhaps some such childish contrivance as this may be in 		use, though unknown to me. I should like to try it, and convince myself of its practicability. As to the material point, guiding the carriage, I can conceive no method; I like to see skaiting, and I should like to see this. Such a light thing on wheels might 	be tried on land; but I doubt the labour would be too much. This nonsense makes me think (as indeed I have always done) what a 	pleasure it must be, to be able to draw. </p>
			<p align="center">————</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I never see a fine prospect but I wish to bring it away with me. The house and grounds at <a class="link_ref" href="../places.html#Wakefield" title="Wakefield">Wakefield</a>, I have in the storehouse of memory; but I should like to have them on paper. I 	should extremely like to have a view of <a class="link_ref" href="../places.html#HoningtonGreen" title="Honington Green">Honington Green</a>, as it was till the Inclosing Act took place. <a class="link_ref" href="../places.html#Wakefield" title="Wakefield">Wakefield</a> I may (though unlikely) see again; but my native Green, with its daisies, I never shall. To take such a small bit of ground and divide it into three, was hardly worth while. What 	man, with a sack of wheat on his back, would stoop for one grain? </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Inclosing Acts! I do not much like the rage for them. They cut down the solemn, the venerable tree, and <em>sometimes</em> plant another, — <em>not always</em>; like a mercenary soldier, who kills more than he begets. Resolved — As shepherds are thus going out of fashion, and smiths, &amp;c., coming in: could I not make the old 	 steeple lament the destruction of shades as old as itself, and make a shepherd reply? &amp;c. &amp;c. But it grows near 'witching time of night,' and I perceive I am writing nonsense. If I had had a critic here at my elbow, he would have found it out 	long ago. </p>
			<p align="center">————</p>
			<p align="center"><em >Remarks on the Garden Spider</em>.</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;">August 14, 1801. — This morning observed a garden spider, who had one of his own species in 	durance, holding him suspended, but without much appearance of a web. The prisoner was alive, but a mere skeleton. After a while he was suffered to fall, or the wind forced him from his captivity; but, in falling, he unfortunately struck against a half-formed	web, the architect of which I had just been watching, and observed, that all the lines leading from the centre to the extremities 		were finished; and he was busy, going a continued circle, and joining each with a fresh web, which he drew from his posteriors, at 	regular strokes, by an extension of his longest legs behind. The beforementioned prisoner fell against his web, and he immediately 	left work to secure him, being still alive, and having legs not at all diminished, though his body was wasted. His new conqueror 	seized him, and, rolling him up in a strong web, dragged him to the centre, and there left him secure, and returned to his work, which he soon completed. I had observed him about a quarter of an hour previous to this adventure, and remarked that he caught a 	number of very small flies, which abounded on every weed, after much rain in the night; and I was not a little surprised that 	these minute creatures did not stop his progress, but were instantly devoured; not as I expected, by sucking their bodies dry: he 		took them up very orderly, and very distinctly, and devoured them, wings and all, without leaving the smallest appearance of a 	fragment. He had eaten seven of these flies before the spider fell in his way. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;">August 20, 1801. — A spider of this kind, of an enormous size, has now a web, of about a foot in	diameter, hung with spoils, against a wooden fence in the yard. I have repeatedly seen them working their webs, but never could	see them begin. The insect, here mentioned, has attached his work on one side to the fence, from which it projects obliquely, and is suspended to a branch of a vine, at the distance of five feet from the circle of the web. As the suspending lines are very	strong, and run exactly horizontally, without any intermediate support, it is wonderful to me, to think how they could have been carried so far. A double five foot line, which leaves the fence in this direction, must have been a curious work for him. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In the outline here given, the upper sketch is looking down on the work; the under one is looking horizontally. </p><div xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center" class="figure"><img src="../images/diagram1.jpg" width="250" height="106"/></div>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The body of the spider being nearly half an inch in length, he has more than twenty-four times his length in one	foot, and, consequently, one hundred and twenty times in his suspending lines. Now, taking the standard of a man at five feet six inches, one hundred and twenty times his length, will be six hundred and sixty feet, or two hundred and twenty yards; about three	times the height of the Monument. <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> If we were set to tie the tops of the steeples of London together with a
			cord, without scaffolding, should not we be puzzled to contrive it? We should go to school to spiders, and ants, and bees; but of all these — the spider does his work <em>alone</em>. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;">September 9, 1801. — This morning, extricated a bee from a web, but without any signs of life. Another web contained a bee larger than the common honey bee; he appeared completely enveloped in a winding-sheet of the web, of a	very large spider, whose premises he had unfortunately trespassed upon. Thus it is evident that this tiger of an insect devours	creatures larger than itself. If the means by which he is enabled to do so were common to the beasts of the forest, how dreadful would be a net spun by the lion or the tiger, from which the horse and his rider could not disentangle themselves, no more than a	strong bee can from this pest of the garden. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;">September 14th, 1801. — Having expressed surprise at the work of a spider, I can now trace with 	certainty his operations and his power, so as to satisfy myself entirely. Often wondering how came all the long; webs that tickle our noses and glitter in the sun, reaching from one tree to another, and often floating loose in the air; I, a few days past, broke down the web of a garden spider, which was suspended from a building to a fence across a pathway of about five feet, and	much the same height from the ground. When his suspending lines were broke, himself and his web fell flat against the building. An	hour or two after, I observed him in motion, and wished to know how he would contrive a communication with the fence as before. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> He seemed, for a while, as if taking a general survey of the distance and bearings of the objects around; and then letting himself down from a spout to the distance of about six inches, hung suspended, not in their usual position, head	downwards, but with one side downwards, and all his legs greatly extended. In this posture I found that, without the help of his	legs, he possessed a power of ejecting a web to what length he pleased, and with surprising swiftness. It had exactly the	appearance of smoke issuing through a pin hole; only, in this case, the stream instead of dissipating, became a lengthening line,	that floated with the action of the wind, and visibly extended from its source, as fast, or faster than the nimblest black beetle	can run. He emitted thus, about seven or eight feet of web, and then ascended to the spout, and waited the event. The line was		carried by the wind cornerways, and lodged against the building, and consequently became useless. He did the same again, with the	same want of success, and repeated his work a fourth time, when I caught hold of his floating line, at about four feet long, and	when extended to five, I drew it over the leaf of a bean, and it became fast; but he, still lengthening it, the line was very	slack. After a few minutes he applied himself to drawing the rope tight, which, when done, he travelled upon it to the opposite	side, and made my fastening secure; then back again, emitting a new web as he went, and joining it to the other to strengthen it,	till it became visibly improved. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Next, starting from one end, he proceeded, without splicing a new strengthener, to the centre of the horizontal	line, <em>exactly to the centre</em>, and there lowered himself down to the ground, and drew this perpendicular line	very tight, or else it was his weight that did it. The ground beneath was a gravel path; he there fastened this line to the	gravel, at E (see sketch), by pressing it down with a motion peculiar to themselves, and then ascended again: at which time he had	formed an obtuse angle, by drawing down the horizontal line; then, forwarding his work, he drew the line D, to which the lines	from the centre were to be fastened. To form the line D, he traversed the lines B C, bearing the line D in his claw detached, and,	fastening it at the upper end of B, proceeded to draw the lines from A to C and B in the same manner. From this outline, the	formation of the lines from the centre to the extremities appeared easy. </p><div xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center" class="figure"><img src="../images/diagram2.jpg" width="250" height="251"/></div>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have sometimes broken down a part of their work, and have observed that they will carefully gather up the	fragments of the web, and either leave it in white knots, or appear entirely to swallow it. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> A <em>small</em> spider had fastened a line of his work, to the outermost lines of a web, belonging to a very <em>large</em> one; the latter hastened to the confines of his premises, and cut asunder the stranger's	holdfast, something like cutting a boat adrift. I find it a common opinion, that the spider, when he catches a fly, destroys him by poison; it may be so; — but I see, by close observation, that his strong dependence is placed in folding him rapidly up in a	web, which he draws from himself abundantly for the purpose. </p>
			<p align="center">————</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I wonder whether I shall hereafter think these moments mispent in watching a spider? — At present I think their	nature and properties strange, and not yet entirely known, even to naturalists; their whole proceedings amazingly curious; their		degree of instinctive contrivance, and their exactness of figure in their squares and angles, and visible <em>use</em>	of every line, truly astonishing. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The spider, while descending by his web, was baited by the flies, in the same manner as we see a hawk baited by the	smaller birds*. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;">October 4th, 1802. — Found last week a letter in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1759 (I think), by a	Mr. Masser, 'on the Gossimer,' <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> wherein he has been correct in his account of the spider having an ejecting power, as to the formation of his	web. I found this by observation last summer, and was pleased at the discovery, for to <em>me</em> it was such. But his account of flying spiders is not clear and comprehensive. Does he mean spiders with wings? or, spiders with a power of
			unlimited elevation, by an ejectment of web? </p>
			<p class="pnonident"> * It is now known, that the spider sometimes exhausts the material from which his web is formed; in which case, he is in imminent		danger of starvation. I once saw a spider reduced to this extremity, running wildly about on a sunny board. Several large flies,	who seemed to enjoy his distress, tormented him, by settling within an inch of his nose; and when the spider made a rush to seize	one, he would take a short flight, and settle down again at about the same distance. This game lasted nearly two hours; when the	spider's strength and patience appearing to be quite worn out, he retired to a hole. — </p>
			<p class="pnonident">Ed. [Note by <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Joseph Weston">Joseph Weston</a>, editor of <cite>The Remains</cite>]</p>
			<p align="center">Spiders again.</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Proved, by observing a spider with a small microscope, that when I had broken down a web in the garden, he carefully gathered up the fragments, and moistening the accumulated web in its approach to his mouth, swallowed it all again. </p>
			<p align="center">General Observations.</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In addition to the foregoing extracts, I now wish to say a word or two in farther explanation. The nests of this 	kind of spider are generally attached fast to woodwork, in a dry situation, in size not exceeding an hazel-nut, appearing like a	knot of raw silk, of an exceeding close texture. I put one of these into an unstopped bottle, and, forgetting to watch it	minutely, I at length found it as follows: From the mouth of the bottle to a shelf above, was about eighteen inches; and I found the eggs hatched, and not less than several hundreds of connecting lines of communication between the bottle and the shelf,	covered in every direction with the infant swarm, entirely yellow. From this I think it evident, that the power of ejecting the		web is exercised at an early stage of life. I think too, from every consideration, that their preying on each other is a matter		beyond a doubt. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have somewhere read, that the garden spider uniformly makes his web of great or small dimensions, according to 	the approaching degree of sunshine or rain, and thus, with the utmost precision, foretels the weather. This I have not yet proved,	but am much inclined to give credit to the assertion. </p>
			<p align="center">————</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Custom not only imposes on us modes of dress, and sometimes of conduct, which our reason does not approve, but prevents us from adopting many a useful practice or improvement. I have read somewhere, of the northern nations, wearing a contrivance of wood, to screen the sight, from the reflection of sunbeams from the snow, which, unobstructed, is injurious to the sight. Custom <em>there</em>, does not forbid them to preserve their eyes; but <em>here</em>, where in the summer months, the sunbeams are reflected from the gravel of the roads, and from the pavement of the streets, in almost an	intolerable manner; — where the evil of too much light is evident in every one's face, and every eye is half-closed to exclude it;	— where thousands, in their walks of pleasure, would gladly gaze on the distant objects before them — the hills, the villages, and		the woods, if the quivering of the sun's rays, and his flood of light would permit them; where thousands (myself amongst them)	come home with the anguish and languor of a headach, and with eye-balls parched and painful, from having been forced to meet a	light ten times stronger than they could bear; if a person, I say, was to put a crape over his eyes, or any contrivance to remedy	the evil, the novelty of his appearance would be a real trouble to him, by subjecting him to the scoffs and insults of fools: and	yet the pleasure of walking with ease to one's self, is a thing which no one will contemn, when he consults <em>reason</em> only. The prevalence of too much light is to me a serious evil, and I am convinced is hurtful to the sight. Our		mothers tell us not to gaze on the sun, and not to read or work by a bad light, thus warning us that extremes are to be avoided; and our <em>feelings</em> tell us to double our clothes in winter, and to strip in summer; to eat our broth when it is		cool enough, and not scald our throats; and many other good things would our feelings tell us, if they were properly attended to. </p>
			<p align="center">————</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> What a wide difference may be seen between the manner of bringing up children, as to the chance they have of seeing	in their youth, what we call the beauties of Nature. If I had been placed in my infancy in the situation of one of the boys who		worked in the same garret with me, — had I possessed the power of writing poetry to please the world, — I must have wanted	materials at least, to have written what I have. Poor Jem Bailey, was, with four others, left motherless; his father turned them over to the workhouse, situated somewhere in Southwark. When Jem became old enough, he was sent out as errand-boy, to any one who	might want such a boy, for which he got nothing but food. He lived with a Doctor, and carried nostrums from morning till night:	his master giving him a livery-coat, to raise his own consequence with those he attended. (This was his best coat when he came as	an apprentice to the boot-trade.) Another of his masters kept a fishing-tackle shop, in Crooked-lane, and of course part of his		trade was to have <em>maggots</em> or <em>gentles</em> to sell to those, who had patience enough to angle in the New River. To obtain this bait, a quantity of bullocks' lights was exposed to the flies on the leads, of the house; and	often have I heard the poor boy express the abhorrence he felt, when called from his dinner to serve a ha'p'orth of gentles, which		was done by shaking the lights, and picking up the fruit. </p>
			<p align="center">————</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Lord Kenyon's <a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="back5"> </a> integrity, as stated in the accounts of trials in the	newspapers, (for I never saw him), gives me the highest idea of the character of a Judge, which I have ever found. His office,	arms him with power: but the exertion of power is marked with the peculiarity of the possessor. The determined and pithy reproofs	he gives to notorious guilt, are the most shining examples of honesty to be found in the language. </p>
			<p align="center">————</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> At the time the Albion Mills were burned, <a href="#6">[6]</a><a name="back6"> </a> I never saw the newspapers; and led so recluse a life, that three days elapsed before I heard of it, though I lived in Chiswell-street; a proof that there may be now	living in Paris, persons, who saw little or nothing of the great events which have taken place there. Again — when five hundred	houses were burning at Ratcliffe, <a href="#7">[7]</a><a name="back7"> </a> some years ago, I did not know it till	the next night! A man's mind may be travelling half over the globe, and yet know little of what is doing next door. </p>

			 </div>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The sovereign contempt with which too many of the wealthy, and (I fear also) of the learned, look upon what are	termed 'the dregs of the people,' has often raised an equal contempt on my side, for that wealth, which engenders such thoughts of	the immense distance, which those 'dregs are from the surface.' The distance is not so great as the vain man flatters himself it	is; I have known mechanics, who in general information, and in powers of intellect, have stood decidedly before thousands of their			own rank. Is it not decidedly so among gentlemen — one clever fellow to a great many dull ones? I have heard more sense and truth	in a tap-room, than I have sometimes heard in better company; and there is nothing more striking to me, (and I have been placed so	as to observe it,) than that <em>total</em> ignorance of the <em>manner of living</em> among the poor —	that superficial and vague idea of who and what they are — of what they talk, and of what they think! Nothing to me has appeared	more strange or more disgusting, than finding amongst those ranks, raised above the mechanic and labourer, such a mean opinion of	the poor! Gentlemen, 'tis true, seldom enter alleys, or see the domestic habits of those nests of human wretchedness: and they	think, perhaps, that poverty must of necessity be accompanied with ignorance ; but I find that a man who works for his living, and reads whatever he can catch——————! His whole soul is bent to that point; and if nature has given him a talent for observation, no	situation can make him contemptible. If a great and noble mind is granted by nature to only one in a thousand — does she order	that that one, shall not be born in an alley? That he must be <em>rich</em>, or <em>great</em>? Does	nature, when she makes an orator, provide him a seat in the House of Commons? — A poor man with a strong mind will make himself	respected in his circle, and make useful remarks on every occurrence. A rich man, with great native powers, will do the same. A		poor man, with a moderate understanding, will remain at the bottom of his class. A rich man of inferior powers will do the same,	in spite of all that can be done for him. </p>

			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> A short time ago, the publicans' paper, <a href="#10">[10]</a><a name="back10"> </a> after stating that the price	of corn and flour did not fall in consequence of an abundant harvest, added — 'Let our avaricious tyrants <em>blush</em>! Let them <em>dread</em> the vengeance of parliament! The <em>guardians</em> of the people!' By placing certain words in italics, I suppose it to be wholly ironical; if not, the joke is better still: for what <em>dreadful</em> punishment will a man inflict on himself? </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In their paper of to-day they finish a paragraph of the same sort thus:— 'How long these plans of extortion are to continue, Heaven only knows — for to Heaven only can the people look for relief.' </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Now by this last sentence, one would think they had found out, that the dealers in corn were not likely to blush,	or to tremble; and that many of them were among the guardians of the people. </p><p align="center">————</p>

artificial tusks (made in imitation of a 	real one, which now lies in the room in a decayed state), are put to this skeleton; but the use of these tusks appears doubtful; 	and perhaps were not placed as they are here. His teeth, prove most clearly, that he did not feed on vegetable food, and yet his 	swallow appears much straitened, for so immense a creature. </p>

Parts of the bones of this 	kind of animal have been found on the banks of the Ohio, and in various other parts of America, to the number, it is supposed, of 	fifty; so that the animal, though now an extinct race, has been numerous; and as remains of shell-fish are found with the bones, it is conjectured that an inundation destroyed the race, and left us to wonder at what must have lived, though so much larger than	any animal now known to exist — not excepting the elephant. Bones of this creature are found vastly much larger than the skeleton. 	A thigh bone now lies in the room, some inches longer than those in the skeleton, and a tooth of seven pounds weight is now at 	Philadelphia. </p>

Suppose a		number of <em>fixed</em> lights to represent the rise and fall of empires. Carthage might brighten to its zenith; and	then Rome might arise in all its glories, and decline likewise. The Ottoman power, and the caliphs of Arabia; the blazing of the butchers of the East; the Tartar princes, and all the principal transactions recorded in history. If this could be done on a	sufficient scale, and the ground-work be a map of the world, and the lights be made governable, as in Walker's orrery <a href="#25">[25]</a><a name="back25"> </a> ——But	this is dreaming! — dreaming! </p>

Mr. Chamberlain, who employed		many hands (my brother and self amongst them), used to have an answer ready for one common excuse. — The journeymen or their wives	would plead that 'they had made all possible haste to shop.' 'That's saying nothing,' says Chamberlain; '<em>you should have set out sooner</em>.' </p>

When a boy, he (<a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#PaineThomas" title="Paine">Paine</a>) went, in company with his	sister — I think it was — to Fakenham wood, in search of nuts; and being by themselves, they wandered out of their knowledge, and	knew not the way out again. In this dilemma, Tom, proposed that his sister should stand at a certain spot, while he went a short	distance to climb some tree, to see his way out of the wood. He climbed the tree, and missing his hold, fell to the ground, and		remembers reviving at the foot of the tree, and finding his sister supporting him. He was bruised, but with whole bones. They were 	belated and frightened; and both agreed to keep it a secret from their father: and Tom, knowing that his father made a practice of 	taking pills, thought that pills might do him good too. He took them accordingly, and luckily without producing any bad effect. He 	got well, and all was secret. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In relating this story of <a href="../people.html#PaineThomas" title="Tom Paine">Tom Paine</a>, Dr. W. remarked, that there are 	many thousands who will probably exclaim, 'What a pity that he had not broke his neck!' But, on the other hand, continued he, when	I heard him relate it at Paris, one exclaimed, 'The guardian angel of liberty was near thee, Thomas.' Dr. W. is a warm republican. 	I think him an intelligent, a good, and an honest man. </p>

With one of them, which was very ailing and fretful, a superstitious cure was attempted. I remember an old woman (Mrs. Osborne, of	Honington) being employed to 'cut the child for the spleen.' The child's ear was cut so as to bleed, and the blood applied on the 	temples <em>in the form of a cross</em>, and, I believe, with something repeated by way of <em>charm</em>; 	for she had charms for the ague, &amp;c. — The child died. </p><p align="center">————</p>

If this is an ancient ballad, and of no uncommon sort, in English villages, how does it happen that	ancient Scotch ballads possess so many beauties? Or are they only sifted from heaps of rubbish like the above? If so, perhaps a		collection of English might be formed by the same means. This ditty, sung to the thrum of the spinning-wheel, had its attractions;	and this girl (now named Thompson), and one of the Whiteheads — I think, Sarah — when a girl, were the only persons who ever sung	the ballad to my fancy. </p>

The barber was gone half a mile from home, to shave a gentleman. He presently came in, and throwing of his hat and wig, gave vent to his perspiration and his anger both together. The	person was gone out when he got there, and he had his walk for nothing! — How abominably these things plague a poor man, anddisconcert his week's work; and he has no remedy — no action for damages ! — The bald-pated, angry old man began his operations		upon me; and I was not quite free from apprehensions on account of his perturbation and appearance — but trust not appearances!	When he had nearly finished, he ordered his girl to wet the corner of a cloth — I wondered what he wanted with it. It was	instantly applied to my face ; and though this was the first time I had had my face washed by a barber, it appeared to be his 	custom.

					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In our trade, when any one reads the newspapers or a book, by the neighbourly custom of sitting all in one room,	and by that great privilege, of its not hindering the progress of our work, we have nothing to do, but to discuss the subject. <em>Commumty</em>, is perhaps the point, to which those who say that 'shoemakers are politicians,' might trace the
					solution of their wonder. But even a newspaper is not all politics. No one can read the daily prints without either learning, or	feeling, his want of geographical knowledge. This must lead him to maps; and maps to reflection: and this reflection, unless it		can be proved that it leads him to discontent, is praiseworthy, and full of pleasure to himself. </p>

					<p style="text-indent:40px;">March, 1810. — Mr. Arnold, painter, of Buckingham-place, near Fitzroy-square, has an extract from the	parish register of Bowes, or Brows, in Yorkshire, which records the burial of Robert Rightson and Mary Railton. The former died in	a fever; the latter almost instantly, on hearing the bell toll for her lover. To this we owe the beautiful ballad of 'Edwin and	Emma,' <a href="#33">[33]</a><a name="back33"> </a> as appears

					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> When I think on Egyptian architecture, it seems an oak in a forest of shrubs. Time sweeps away the habitations of	men — the under-works of art — as man sweeps away the underwood of a forest: but the pyramid and the oak remain. If London should	sink into oblivion, or at least dwindle into a village, what will be the most imperishable thing in the ruin? The foundations of	the bridges would stand a good tug against the assaults of time, and the proud cathedral would hold its elevated ruins full of	owls and ivy; still to be wondered at, when the dwellings should be no more. The greatest undertakings that I know of, now going on, are the Wet Docks at the Isle of Dogs. <a href="#34">[34]</a><a name="back34"> </a> Thirty acres of land sunk to so great a depth seems a huge attempt; but it is only digging a hole after all! If	it could be possible for London to become a Babylon, the chafings and surgings of old Father Thames — for HE would not stop ––	would leave no traces of labour or art in the docks; nature would soon blot out the boast of a nation, and the strong arm of the	invariable tide . . . . But I was going to say, that I could almost wish for some edifice, in or near the capital, that should	perpetuate the site of the city. And yet if the walls of Babylon were indeed as substantial as they are said to have been, where	are they gone? </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> When London-people walk out of town, like bees from a hive (only seldom on so good an errand), how entirely	unacquainted they appear to be, with the warning which the rising clouds give of the approach of a shower. It looks strange, if	not laughable, to see a number of well-dressed people, sauntering with the utmost composure from their homes, full in the face of	a black and threatening cloud, which in ten minutes is to involve them in trouble and vexation. But though the countryman keeps		his eyes on the heavens, and preserves a dry coat, he could not turn a corner, or escape a hackney coach, with the dexterity of a Londoner. Every one to his trade! </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> A brother-tradesman in the City-road has inscribed over his stall, </p>
					<p align="center">'MASON,</p>
					<p align="center"><em>Shoemaker and Repairer in general</em>.'</p>

					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I think that ambition, courage, and sensibility may 'run in the blood,' as we term it. Should any one of these	qualities, or any conspicuous vice or virtue, actually belong to a family, which happens to govern a nation, such inherent quality		ought to be expected in <em>any</em> of its branches; even if the party is not known to be of the family, or is in	disguise, as is frequently represented in novels and plays. But that a hidden something, an <em>innate nobility</em>,	a <em>royalty by nature</em>, should be looked for in every great personage, or person raised accidentally to power,	is nonsense in itself, and it is almost criminal to propagate it as a doctrine. Mr. Home has made Norval a true Douglas, <a href="#35">[35]</a><a name="back35"> </a> possessing his forefathers' courage; but I have read several things,	which I could not now name, which, in this unnatural distortion of character, were shamefully disgusting. Perhaps this is only	saying that they were not written by such men as Home, who knows what belongs to character and what to accident. </p>

					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Could not I, as a shoemaker, gather all possible accounts relating to those who have figured in the world from our		trade? Was not Secretary Craggs <a href="#36">[36]</a><a name="back36"> </a> a chip of	leather? Suppose I verify the old story of Crispin? I wonder nobody has yet ridiculed me and my garret poetry: perhaps a few					successful attempts would bring garrets into repute, as they ought to be, for they have their advantages; — such as silence, air,					cheapness, &amp;c. </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> A few months back, one of the newspapers stated something about making all the roads in England straight!

					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> It is not good to be too silent in company. It being insufferably hot last night, drank some ale in a public-house	in the City-road, and being election-time for the county members, was taken for a government spy. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Two stanch friends of Sir Francis <a href="#37">[37]</a><a name="back37"> </a> declared they loved	his cause, and were ready and willing to fight for it; and poured forth a torrent of abuse against '<em>spies and	collectors of seditious words</em>.' I came away and left them in their error, with the silent imputation on my head; and	could not help reflecting, that if fifteen days' contention at Brentford, could warm men enough to make them fight for their	cause, what is the wonder that the men of Paris (when actually murdered by hundreds) should murder again? They make or conceive a	provocation, and weigh it, and act upon it, that instant! An angry man is the pest of a company; an angry company is the pest of a	neighbourhood; an angry nation is a curse to the world! </p>
					<p align="center">CRITICAL REMARKS</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I never could reconcile to harmony, or even common smoothness, the concluding lines of Pope's description of the		death of the Duke of Buckingham, beginning, </p>
					<div xmlns="" class="lg">
					<p style="text-indent:120px;"> 'In the worst inn's worst room,' &amp;c.</div></div>
					<p class="pnonident">and finishing, </p>
					<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
					<p> 'There, victor of his health, of fortune, friends. </br>
					 And fame, this lord of useless thousands ends.' <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#38">[38]</a><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="back38"> </a></p>
					</div>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have often wondered that Pope, so remarkable for harmony, should not feel a harshness here, and that ——</p>
					<p align="center">————</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Similes in poetry, unless excellently good, are blemishes instead of beauties. When reading Dryden's Virgil,
					whenever I came to an animated passage, and found the author going to look about him to compare it with something else, I felt a		vacuum, and then a kind of joy, to find he was again going on with the description, which was higher and nobler than the thing
					brought into comparison. I <em>often</em> feel the same; and the more strikingly sudden the digression is made, so		much more reason, has the reader to expect something, to pay him for looking off. —I don't like them, or I should have used more. </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Dibdin's song of 'Tom Bowling' <a href="#39">[39]</a><a name="back39"> </a> compares the trumpet, which is to rouse into		animation countless myriads of creatures — a world of dust — to what? to a boatman's whistle, and consequently, the Almighty to a	captain!! Now, how is it — am I superstitious — or is this really natural, and not too bad?</p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p align="center"><em>Coincidences</em>.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> While my Rural Tales were printing, I first got sight of Mr. Wordsworth's Ballads, and was startled to find him	saying, in the 'Idiot Boy,'</p>
					<div xmlns="" class="lg"><p style="text-indent:120px;"> 'That Pony's worth his weight in gold.'</div></div>
					<p class="pnonident">I had written, without seeing or dreaming of Mr. Wordsworth's remark, almost the same words in 'Market Night:' </p><div xmlns="" class="lg">
					<p style="text-indent:120px;">'That Beast is worth his weight in gold.' <a href="#40">[40]</a><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="back40"> </a></div></div>
					<p class="pnonident">Now if unborn critics should dispute about this, as I fear they will about many such trifles, I would say (could I rise from the	grave), 'Mr. W. wrote and published his book first, and I had not seen it.' I would beg the learned searchers after imitations and	curious coincidences, to give all reasonable scope to charity, and to admit, in all cases, the kindred ideas which must exist in	tracing the same subject. I have read some such speculations on other writings with disgust. RESOLVED to 'write to George about	it.' </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p align="center"><em>A large Picture by <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="link_ref" href="../people.html#WestallRichard" title="Westall">Westall</a>, called 'A Storm in Harvest.' </em><a href="#41">[41]</a><a name="back41"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The sheaves, whether meant for barley or wheat, are a bad crop; more straw than corn, or rather, the straw is not		defined. It appears in the stem as a bundle of fine grass, and there are not ears enough (reckoning a stem to each and no more) to	make a sheaf of a quarter the size.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The couple approaching from the field, on the left, are driven on violently by the storm; and yet the man and woman in the foreground are sitting <em>facing</em> the weather! The man is an Abelard — never saw a Suffolk codger like	him. The old man's hand to his chin <em>right good</em>. The old woman has the best birth as to shelter; but is it not	natural for men as well as beasts to turn their backs to the weather? I wish <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#WestallRichard" title="Mr. Westall">Mr.	Westall</a> had brought the waggon and horses forwarder.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I like the old man and woman best of the group, and they may be all highly creditable to the artist, — but to me	they are not English faces. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> In <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#WestallRichard" title="Mr. Westall">Mr. Westall</a>'s 'Peasant Boy,' I like his attitude; but his	clothing, from the waist downward, is in the Bond-street cut. Such breeches and stockings were never on a peasant boy, unless they	came to him at second-hand from the squire. Well done, Robin, for a critic!!</p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Just borrowed from <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#RogersSamuel" title="Mr. Rogers">Mr. Rogers</a> the first volume of <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#SoutheyRobert" title="Mr. Southey's">Mr. Southey's</a> 'Thalaba;' and amongst a thousand charming instances of powerful 	description, one strikes my mind, not from its intrinsic merit, great as it is, so much as from the similarity of the thought to what I have written in my wild mood, at page —— of this book, about three years ago. When I contemplated the destruction of London, I imagined, perhaps truly, that old Thames would roll on the same as if London had never been. Mr. Southey, after bringing his Arabian boy to the ruins of Babylon, makes the following lines a part of his description: </p>
					<div class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
					<p> 'The wandering Arab never sets his tent <br>
					Within her walls. — The shepherd eyes afar <br>
					Her evil towers — and devious drives his flock. <br>
					Alone, unchanged, a free and bridgeless tide <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Euphrates rolls along: <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Eternal Nature's work!' <a href="#42">[42]</a><a name="back42"> </a></p></div>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> If my nonsense had been publicly seen — would the reader have said, I took the idea from <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#SoutheyRobert" title="Southey">Southey</a>, or that he took it from me? </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The conclusion — when the mind is fixed upon such contemplations, is so natural and inevitable, that if twenty	persons were to reflect, and speak out their reflections, they would be all nearly alike. Every one knows that a river was prior to, and will outlast a town. The question is, can they make their reflections and descriptions, nip hold of the soul, like <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#SoutheyRobert" title="Southey's">Southey's</a>? </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Again, on the score of coincidences. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have long ago composed a ballad, called 'Emma's Kid.' Having to make, by desire of <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#BuchanLord" title="Lord Buchan">Lord Buchan</a>, a pair of shoes for his lady, the verses had some kind of reference, the	shoes being made of <em>kid</em> leather. <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#BuchanLord" title="Lord Buchan">Lord Buchan</a> had a copy, which I
					afterwards regretted, as I conceited that I had mended it on a second attempt; but having never liked it, it lies in my condemned	regiment. <a href="#43">[43]</a><a name="back43"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Having a commission lately, to buy for a lady a copy of Shenstone's poems, I found there a poem called 'The dying	kid.' <a href="#44">[44]</a><a name="back44"> </a> The similarity surprised me, and disgusted me too. Shenstone's is a beautiful piece, and mine wants every thing	which it should have; and if it had been published, the world would have said — and I doubt not that <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#BuchanLord" title="Lord Buchan">Lord Buchan</a> does say — that it is an humble imitation of what in truth I had never seen!	A great deal of the ill-natured and uncandid stuff which is written upon the misconceived subject of 'coincidences,' is little	superior in wisdom to the boy's exclamation — 'La, uncle! why your Essex moon is just like our Suffolk moon!'</p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I saw last May, for the first time in my life, the exhibition at Somerset House. In the room set apart for	statuary, the most natural, and consequently the most beautiful thing in the room, was an infant on its mother's lap, making part of a monumental group by Nollikens. <a href="#45">[45]</a><a name="back45"> </a> I noticed that	every woman who approached it, put on such a look, as pleaded powerfully for their own right feelings, and for the artist. I never
					felt more from any work of art than from that. </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p align="center"><cite>The Dead Soldier </cite>.<a href="#46">[46]</a><a name="back46"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> When first I saw this picture, or rather the engraving from the picture, I was highly pleased to find so much done 	with so few faces, or rather with one face; for none but the infant's is seen. There is more expression in the grasp of the		mother's hand, than in twenty wry faces and bloody swords. The infant, too, is like an infant, perfectly unconscious. How 	abominable it is ever to represent them otherwise; and yet in that showy thing of the family leaving the deserted village, I must, think this fault is obvious, and to me disgusting. Another plate, a fellow to it, has a ring of dancers, but it is not English 	rusticity. I know not who painted the pictures; I remember seeing them in the shop windows, and did not like them. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#RogersSamuel" title="S. Rogers">S. Rogers</a>, Esq. author of the 'Pleasures of Memory,' has a set of drawings of children by <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#StothardThomas" title="Stothard">Stothard</a>. Nobody would find in them an unnatural or adult stiffness of 	body, or a meaning or consciousness which children possess not. I never saw <a class="link_ref" href="../people.html#StothardThomas" title="Mr. Stothard">Mr. 		Stothard</a>, but he has my sincere admiration. </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p align="center"><em>Mrs. Robinson's Lyrical Tales </em>.<a href="#47">[47]</a><a name="back47"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The first piece, 'All alone,' I don't like, for these reasons: It possesses the fault of many pictures which I have	noticed; more susceptibility is given to the child than he could possess. The boy could not, nor would not, remember the time when 	he was just learning to talk, and consequently could not say, </p>
					<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
					<p> 'I felt her breast with rapture bound. <br>
					 When first I prattled on her knee.' <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#48">[48]</a><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="back48"> </a></p>
					</div><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The <em>grief</em> of a child could not, I think, be strong enough to induce him to sleep, night after	night, in a churchyard! </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> There seems none of these imperfections in her 'Shepherd's Dog.' I like it extremely. 'He is not mad,' is a good	stroke; it has more in it than the 'All alone' and the 'Lascar' put together. Mrs. Robinson's delineations of nature are vivid,	but I cannot think them just. I should like to see what the critics will say — or have said of them. </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p align="center" id="LyricalBallads"><em>Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads </em>.<a href="#49">[49]</a><a name="back49"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I go with pleasure and anxiety along with 'Betty Fay' by moonlight: it was truly a charming night. 'The Thorn,'	with all its simplicity, I shall never forget. 'Simon Lee,' 'We are seven,' and 'The Nightingale,' in their eve-like nakedness, I	feel greatly pleased with. <em>Resolved</em> to read them through attentively. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I don't much relish 'The Pet Lamb.' The 'Poet's Reverie' sounds too much like a madman's reverie. It should not be	in the same book with 'Michael' and 'The Brothers.'</p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Is it right to say 'skies?' 'The stars in the skies,' &amp;c. One charming blue covers the apparent concave	over our heads. If we were whelmed under a bowl, should we say the stars in the bowls? I have used this kind of plurality of <em>skies</em> several times but it don't sound right to my ear, or apprehension. </p>
					<p align="center">————</p>
					<p align="center"><em>Children's Books</em>.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I never get hold of a child's book but I feel an inclination to see how the story is told, be it ever so simple. If		I can judge by my girls, the minds of children are much interested by such as are well written; and it appears of much importance	to have them adapted to their years, by the exclusion of words which they cannot be acquainted with:— and, surely, if that curse of beauty and loveliness — affectation, was unsparingly attacked, it would have a good effect. 'Jemima Placid' is a charming thing	in this way. <a href="#50">[50]</a><a name="back50"> </a> 'Virtue in a	Cottage,' <a href="#51">[51]</a><a name="back51"> </a> is a most pleasing and naturally told story, written by somebody who had seen something, besides the shop windows in Cheapside. I shall remember the 'Dog's nose' in 'Goody- two-shoes,'<a href="#52"> [52]</a><a name="back52"> </a> as long as I live. My mother read it to me and my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HingstonElizabeth" title="sister">sister</a>, when	very young, and enforced its precepts, and its excellent hits at superstition, in a manner which I shall ever esteem the greatest	of her favours, and the most unquestionable proof of her love and her understanding. As soon as I can find time, I mean to try my	hand at some trifle for the use of children.* </p>
					<p class="pnonident"> * This benevolent and useful design Mr. Bloomfield executed in part by the publication of 'Little Davy,' in 1815, (a book which	still continues popular,) and afterwards by an attempt to establish in his family, what was to be called '<a class="link_ref" href="birdsinsects.html" title="The Bird and Insect Post-office">The Bird and Insect Post-office</a>.' The design was to instruct his own children, and	others, in natural history, by a method so simple and agreeable, that I am surprised it was never thought of before. This method was to keep up a correspondence between different beasts and insects upon topics connected with their habits and supposed	feelings. The correspondence was to be conducted by the junior branches of his family, who were thus engaged to impart to each	other, in the form of letters, such knowledge of animated nature as they could acquire from books or observation.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Unhappily, Mr. Bloomfield deferred this undertaking until that woful period when his health had declined — his		spirits become dejected — and his circumstances involved in embarrassment and vexation. </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> With powers thus enfeebled, it is not wonderful that the correspondence broke off; but I think it will gratify the reader to publish, as follows, the intercourse so far as it proceeded. </p>

						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						<p> A tear bedews my Delia's eye, <br>
						 To think yon playful kid must die; <br>
						 From crystal spring, and flowery mead, <br>
						 Must, in his prime of life, recede! </p>
						</div>
						
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						<p> Erewhile, in sportive circles round <br>
						 She saw him wheel, and frisk, and bound;<br>
						 From rock to rock pursue his way, <br>
						 And, on the fearful margin, play. </p>
						</div>
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						
						<p> Pleas'd on his various freaks to dwell, <br>
						 She saw him climb my rustic cell; <br>
						 Thence eye my lawns with verdure bright, <br>
						 And seem all ravish'd at the sight. </p>
						</div>
					<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						
						<p> She tells with what delight he stood, <br>
						 To trace his features in the flood:<br>
						 Then skip'd aloof with quaint amaze; <br>
						 And then drew near, again to gaze. </p>
						</div>
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						
						<p> See tells me, how with eager speed <br>
						 He flew, to hear my vocal reed; <br>
						 And how, with critic face profound, <br>
						 And stedfast ear, devour'd the sound. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						<p> His every frolic, light as air, <br>
						 Deserves the gentle Delia's care; <br>
						 And tears bedew her tender eye, <br>
						 To think the playful kid must die.— </p>
						</div>
						
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						<p> But knows my Delia, timely wise, <br>
						 How soon this blameless æra flies? <br>
						 While violence and craft succeed; <br>
						 Unfair design, and ruthless deed! <br>
						</div>
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						
						<p> Soon would the vine his wounds deplore, <br>
						 And yield her purple gifts no more; <br>
						 Ah soon, eras'd from every grove <br>
						 Were Delia's name, and Strephon's love. </p>
						</div>
						
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						<p> No more those bow'rs might Strephon see, <br>
						 Where first he fondly gaz'd on thee; <br>
						 No more those beds of flow'rets find, <br>
						 Which for thy charming brows he twin'd. </p>
						</div>
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
												<p> Each wayward passion soon would tear <br>
						His bosom, now so void of care; <br>
						 And, when they left his ebbing vein, <br>
						 What, but insipid age, remain? </p>
						</div>
						
						<div xmlns="" class="lg" style="margin-left:120px;">
						<p> Then mourn not the decrees of fate, <br>
						 That gave his life so short a date;<br>
						 And I will join thy tenderest sighs, <br>
						 To think that youth so swiftly flies!</p>

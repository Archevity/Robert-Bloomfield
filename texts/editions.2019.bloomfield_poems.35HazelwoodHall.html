        <p class="indent0 ">Bloomfield&rsquo;s only play, <span  class="titlem">Hazelwood-Hall</span> (1823), the last new work published in his lifetime, was never staged.          Finished only a few months before, and published in the month of, Bloomfield&rsquo;s death (August) by <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="link_ref" type="m" href="../people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Baldwin">Baldwin</a>, Cradock and Joy, it appeared in a smaller edition than his previous works (750 in          duodecimo, priced 3 shillings). It was reviewed badly and sold so poorly that, writing to <a class="link_ref" type="m" href="../people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Bloomfield&rsquo;s daughter">Bloomfield&rsquo;s daughter</a> after his death, the publishers were unwilling to put any value on the          copyright, of which Bloomfield had sold them a half share (see <a class="link_ref" href="../letterEEd.25.369.html" title="Letter 369">Letter 369</a>, 2 May 1823 and <a class="link_ref" href="../letterEEd.25.373.html" title="Letter 373">Letter 373</a>, 1 October 1823).</p>
        <p class="indent0 ">The drama was clearly a product of the same years of poverty, illness and anxiety as <em>May-Day with the Muses</em>,          for it too conjured up a village in which the vulnerability of the labouring classes to exploitation&mdash;sexual and social&mdash;is a spectre summoned          only to be banished by collective action by the poor. Thus, Mary, a poor, innocent village girl is the target of the seducer Jack Whirlwind,          a visiting rake who represents fast, fashionable, urban values. Whirlwind is defeated as he tries to abduct Mary in his latest-model          carriage: Joel Spokeum, the reliable, honest village wheelwright cudgels him. In the end, a proper marriage is made, a legacy having been          discovered, presided over by Squire Morrison. In effect, the villagers are enabled to enforce traditional standards of behaviour (a moral          economy) because the community is protected by a benevolent, paternalist squire of the old school, rather than an &lsquo;improving&rsquo;
          agriculturalist who encloses the land or a profligate absentee landlord. By 1823, the public had encountered this scenario many times before  in Bloomfield&rsquo;s work, and to many it now seemed quaintly nostalgic, out of touch with both social conditions on the ground and with the          increasingly cosmopolitan tastes of the educated classes. It was limited, too, by Bloomfield&rsquo;s inexperience as a dramatist: the plot is          hackneyed, depending upon unconvincing reversals of fortune; the characters are flat, lacking individual ways of speaking; there is little
          on-stage action. <cite>The British Magazine </cite>(1 (1823), 210&ndash;12) was blunt: &lsquo;it is more like a Sunday-school tract in dialogue than a          drama &hellip; at the best, puerile: there is nothing in it to deserve criticism&rsquo;. <cite>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine </cite>(93, part 2 (1823), 499),
          writing after Bloomfield&rsquo;s death, was politer, but concurred: it &lsquo;has nothing but simplicity and the name of <em >Bloomfield</em>          to recommend it&rsquo; it declared, lamenting the fact that Bloomfield&rsquo;s last publication should have been his weakest. </p>
        <br/><br/>
        <p class="center ">ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</p>
        <p class="indent0 "><span class="smallcaps">This</span> little dramatic sketch is not so new as it may appear to be. So long ago as the year 1805, a gentleman met me on the
          sands at Worthing, and asked me to his house, &amp;c. but I never saw him afterwards. He gave his address, &lsquo;Mr. Goldhawk, Hazelwood-Hall,         Leith-Hill, Surrey.&rsquo; The names never left my mind, and I then thought of trying them in a village tale, or drama, which I actually began.
          The subject has slept ever since, until the publication of my &lsquo;May Day,&rsquo; last spring, left me leisure and inclination to put it into its
          present form. I make no pretensions to a knowledge of the &lsquo;dramatic unities,&rsquo; or of what is called &lsquo;stage effect.&rsquo; It may be like twenty
          plays, which I have never seen. The characters are exclusively villagers, with the exception of <em xmlns="">Jack Whirlwind</em>; through
          whom I have endeavoured to censure the horrible vice of seducing unguarded females, and then leaving them to scorn and misery.</p>
        <p class="indent0 ">If the more fastidious reader should by chance lay his hand on this trifle, and should object to the very name of play, or
          drama, such reader is assured that he will not find in it either an oath, a pun, or an innuendo. Whatever may be its fate, even if it should
          ultimately get upon the stage, and be subjected to what may be thought the necessary bolsters, stays, and clippings, and these should be
          actual improvements, I shall have nothing to do with them. It is very natural that, thus situated, I should wish to be answerable for
          nothing but what I here print: and I remain the reader&rsquo;s</p>

        <p class=" "><em xmlns="">Enter </em><span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Spokeum</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Joel, Joel, my boy; What ails you; I was going to ask you yesterday, only you looked so
          strangely, I thought it would be of no use.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s all our work running behind, sadly behind: here is Captain Goldhawk&rsquo;s cart should have
          gone home a fortnight ago, and&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name&rsquo;s wheelbarrow&mdash;</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>I can&rsquo;t help it, father. You do but little yourself; you are so taken up with your machine and
          your contrivances; which I doubt will end in nothing.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Whatever I am doing, Joel, I am not in love; but I have observed, that since you have been
          acquainted with your Mary, up at the Hall, you are always singing or sighing, reading or scribbling: you are quite an altered young man.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>I hope you don&rsquo;t think me altered for the worse, father. If you do, I can&rsquo;t tell when I shall be
          better.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>But could not you love her as other people love, that is, <em xmlns="">reasonably</em>? for
          there is &lsquo;reason in roasting of eggs,&rsquo; as my father used to say. But you will have your own way, I suppose.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Nay, don&rsquo;t say so, father. I remember the time when I pleased you long ago, by taking your
          advice. Don&rsquo;t you recollect when all the boys in the parish planned how to rob Lady Hazelwood&rsquo;s orchard, and I would not go? And don&rsquo;t you
          remember you gave me a shilling&mdash;a whole shilling for myself, because I refused?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Yes, I recollect it; that was well done: but I don&rsquo;t ask you to forsake Mary Maythorn.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>It would be of no use if you did.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Well, since you are so short with me, I will leave you and see after the brewing. I will send old
          Judith to you. </p>
        <p class="right ">[<em xmlns="">Exit </em><span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Spokeum</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Well, you are a good old dad enough, but you are a queer one. Your machine, indeed !&mdash;A machine to
          pick hops! Hah! hah! hah!<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#1">&nbsp;[1]</a><a name="1back">&nbsp;</a> Now if courting a

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Well, Judie, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? all in a fluster as usual,&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Jud. </em>Why, your father has been so taken up lately with his cogs and wheels and contrivances, that he
          don&rsquo;t like, he says, to have his thoughts disturbed in this way.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>No, nor I mine. I work my full hours, Judie, and do his work as well as my own; what does he want
          more?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Jud. </em>Well, don&rsquo;t be angry, child. You know your father is rather obstinate and conceited; but I&rsquo;ll keep
          him quiet as well as I can, if you will follow your duty, and not let this Mary Maythorn turn your brain too much.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Ay, now you talk sense; I will follow my duty and my inclination too. But what do you think of
          our new neighbour, Captain Goldhawk?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Jud. </em>Why, I think him a mighty kind, civil gentleman as ever came into a village; but I don&rsquo;t know what
          to make of his man, Gosling John, as you call him: he has just passed by with Betty, the servant at Squire Morrison&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>That&rsquo;s all right; let him go any way he pleases, and I shall go to Hazelwood-Hall when I can,
          that you may depend upon. Come, come, see after the dumplings, and let me alone; my heart is all sunshine. </p>

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Well, my good neighbour, how do you do this fine morning? How do you like your new situation? Does
          it answer your expectation? Will it do? We have very few finer in this part of England, I assure you.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Do, squire&mdash;ay, to admiration! and I am so near my old play-fellow, the lady of the mansion there,
          that&rsquo;s a comfort to a man of my quiet habits; for I have done roving: I have seen enough of the world, and wish for peace here beside the
          forest, where I can walk without being jostled.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Yes, a fine country for musing, and for sporting, too; and that&rsquo;s what I practise most of the two:
          plenty of birds, captain, plenty of birds.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold.</em> Oh! plenty of birds, out-door birds, and indoor birds; and sometimes it happens that one single
          bird is pursued with more pleasure than all the rest.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>What do you mean, captain!</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>What, you don&rsquo;t know, I suppose? then your gun must be readier than your apprehension before you
          do much execution in the field. What say you to my neighbour&rsquo;s lovely daughter, ha? I am not blind, squire, I am not blind: she is, in
          truth, a charming creature!</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Well, so she is then; for I scorn to boggle about a falsehood, when truth comes to my tongue&rsquo;s end
          without any trouble.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>That&rsquo;s well said; give me your hand upon that. I think you will turn out to be one of my sort of
          fellows at last; but I have seen young men as sensible to the charms of a woman as you can possibly be, and yet their intentions were not
          honourable.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Oh! they must have been some of your army gentlemen; now I never was a soldier in my life, and
          never mean to be, unless my country should be in danger: my great-grandfather&rsquo;s sword is rusty.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>I guess by your name, Donald Morrison, your family must have come from the North, is it not so?
          It has a twang of the Scotch in it.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>You are right; my great-grandfather bought this estate; for the Scots are like many other birds of
          passage, they love to travel southward.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>O don&rsquo;t talk of travelling, friend Donald, I have had my fill of it; my day is over.</p>

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Lady H. </em>Very well. [<em xmlns="">Exit Servant.</em>] Now this is kind of them; I like morning visits
          exceedingly; people are then, or ought to be, fresh from repose, and have all their faculties about them, like the new-risen day. What say

          and as to Morrison, he is so frank and cheerful, if I did not respect him, I should be behind all the children in the parish; for everybody
          loves him. I never saw a boy run from him for fear of correction in my life, though sometimes they richly deserve it.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Lady H. </em>Very cautious, my dear. Well, let it be <em xmlns="">respect </em>then, and I can join in it

        <p class="indent1 ">Miss Hazelwood&mdash;Miss <em xmlns="">Hygeia</em>, it would be mere compliment to ask after your health, your face tells tales; I&rsquo;ll warrant,
          you have had one of your six-o&rsquo;clock rambles this morning.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Emma. </em>Not quite so early, sir; but I have had a charming walk down to the edge of the forest, and have
          been talking to the boldest of the deer, that always meet me there: I have one little doe, which I have made as tame as a pet lamb. I cannot
          think how you men can be so barbarous as to molest and injure such beautiful animals!</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Nay, don&rsquo;t look at me so, my dear Emma; I never shot a buck in my life, I assure you.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Emma. </em>That may be; but you are very happy with half a dozen dogs round you, a whistle in your
          whiphandle, a bugle in your belt, and a bag full of hares and pheasants.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Well, but, my life, would you make a Hindoo of me? must I believe in transmigration? why I should
          be terrified in aiming at a bird, for fear of shooting my own grandfather.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>I once shot a tiger; but I had no tender lady by my side, either to applaud or rebuke me.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Emma. </em>O dear, captain, pray don&rsquo;t call it a rebuke; I meant no harm, indeed I did not: but if rebuke it
          was, it would be perfectly useless; for field-sports to a country gentleman form an essential part of his existence; he would feel and look
          as ridiculous without a gun as without a hat.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Ah, you are a trimmer, Emma; but let us change the subject.&mdash;Pray when were you last in London?
          Don&rsquo;t you long to be there sometimes?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Emma. </em>Never at this season, I assure you: you must speak to my mamma about that.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Lady H. </em>Captain Goldhawk, I have been talking to Mary about going to London, and how she would like it,
          and she says she could not stir out of doors without a protector; and I have assured her, that enthusiast as she is after flowers, she would
          be sadly disappointed.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Ay, so you would, child; there is not a bed of violets to be found, if you search Cheapside from
          one end to the other&mdash;is there, Morrison?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Lady H. </em>But talking of protectors in London, or anywhere else, I was always of opinion, that a woman of
          sense and virtue carries her own protection with her, if she chooses to call it into action&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think so, Emma? &lsquo;Lovely Truth&rsquo;&mdash;you
          understand me.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Emma. </em>O perfectly, mamma; but I cannot sing it alone&mdash;Mr. Morrison must help me.</p>

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>Well, but, dear sir, the person you allude to knows no more of London than myself; and, besides,

          you are saying: yes, there are gentlemen protectors in abundance;&mdash;but thanks to the laws, the Bench and the Fleet prison have taken care of
          a great number of them; and I heartily wish that the gallows may take the rest.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>Surely, sir, you are too severe now.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Not at all, child; who would hesitate about hanging a wolf? all the difference between us is,
          that I know something about them, and you nothing. Be a good girl Lady Hazelwood, I have spent a long morning with you; I must get into the

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>It is indeed quiet, serene, and beautiful, and I can compare it to nothing better than a good

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>And then to think that the very turf on which you now tread will, in the turn of a season, be

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>Indeed, that is a most heart-stirring delicious season: what a pity it is so soon over!</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>I wish I could talk, my dear Mary&mdash;I wish I could talk to you as the gentlemen do, all in fine

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>Well, I am sure, Joel, I never wished you could; for I really think you will talk well enough for
          anybody whilst you speak truth.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Bless you for that! I have been hard at work all day, that is one satisfaction, and I am glad the
          night is come. How the gentlemen and ladies have spent the time, I know not; but I think Squire Morrison ought to be happy with the Lady

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Then Squire Morrison is the very man I would select for her out of ten thousand.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>Here is somebody coming up the cross-path! Who can it be?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Oh! I know her by her gait; it is Betty, Squire Morrison&rsquo;s servant: let us not avoid her.</p>

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>What, and all alone, Betty? What, was not John at home?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Betty. </em>What&rsquo;s that to you, Mr. Saucebox? Mind your own business. A body can&rsquo;t stir out of a night

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>I don&rsquo;t like this, Joel; it shows a want of feeling to pounce thus upon the girl when she has
          nobody with her. What do you know of her?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>O very little indeed; I have seen her often on the green: she is a good, kind-hearted, silly girl

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>That is nothing against her, however: What makes you call her silly? perhaps I can find one or

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>What he! What, Gosling John! He dare not for his life; I would break every bone in his skin.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>And even Squire Morrison has looked at me at times in a manner which I thought I ought not to
          understand.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>You must be mistaken, Molly; you certainly must be mistaken; they&mdash;they dare not.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>Oh! as to daring, Joel, you men often dare things which do not become you: for instance&mdash;a young
          man lately attempted to kiss a young woman with whom he had no business, and then, to crown all, told his chosen one (of all people) what a
          rebuff he had met with.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Oh! botheration&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;what shall I say next <em xmlns="">(aside)</em>&mdash;Hem !&mdash;Well, but
          Molly, I say, when half a dozen village girls, giggling and romping, get round one, what is one to do with them? What can one do with them,
          that&rsquo;s all!</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>I&rsquo;ll tell you in your own language. When such a thing happens, just let them alone, that&rsquo;s
          all!</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Well, if you won&rsquo;t be angry any longer, drown me for a puppy, if ever I kiss one of them again.
          There, will that satisfy you?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>I am not hard-hearted, Joel but you are very foolish.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Joel. </em>Well, I always thought I was a little so; we won&rsquo;t differ about that. I&rsquo;ll sing you a song
          presently, and make it all up again, if you will say that you will forgive me in your heart.</p>

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Did not Mr. Morrison say he would call on me this afternoon?</p>

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Your servant, captain&mdash;don&rsquo;t let me disturb your privy council.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>O there is nothing private about the matter&mdash;(don&rsquo;t go away, John)&mdash;I want a few words with this
          honest simpleton, nothing more.&mdash;John, did you not once tell me that your father sold a little freehold?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gos. </em>Eese, sir.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>What, you have not left that <em xmlns="">eese </em>off yet?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gos. </em>Indeed, your honour, I have been trying hard at it for this fortnight; I think I mend a little,
          and if I can&rsquo;t conquer, I must say <em xmlns="">ay </em>all the rest of my life.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Well, but your father sold the place?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gos. </em>He did so, sir; he was poor and in distress: but the lawyers and the purchasers kept him out of
          his money nearly seven years, and I believe he never got it all at last.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>John, this must be inquired into; I will bear it in mind.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>But how came you by your nickname? why do they call you <em xmlns="">Gosling </em>John?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gos. </em>Why, as thus, sir: I had a fancy to look over the county list of freeholders, to find my father&rsquo;s
          name &mdash;the name could not be found. I then looked for Duck Bottom, which is the name of the place&mdash;I could not find that. I then found out
          that the names were all written the <em xmlns="">backward wayses</em>, and that I must look for G; and there, sure enough, I found &lsquo;<em xmlns="">Gosling, John, of Duck Bottom.</em>&rsquo;</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>O, the name <em xmlns="">was </em>there then?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gos. </em>Ay, the name was there after a fashion; and so because I had never seen that way of writing
          before, and made a kind of talk about it amongst my neighbours, they have called me Gosling John ever since.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Never mind a nickname, John, if it carries no disgrace with it.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gos. </em>Why, that&rsquo;s just what I have been thinking, sir. There&rsquo;s the old man, who is now coming up the
          path, has a nickname as well as I; they call him <em xmlns="">Old Hops</em>, but I never could find why, or what they meant by it, for he
          is no more lame than I am.</p>

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>I hope it won&rsquo;t offend your honour, but being rather short of cash, I have brought a small
          bill.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Well, see that you are paid before you leave the house&mdash;that&rsquo;s soon settled; but I am sorry to
          hear that you are short of cash. Some of your neighbours call you a schemer, and turn you into ridicule; do you know it?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>It is very true, sir, that I am laughed at, but I laugh too; that&rsquo;s the way to go through the
          world, as my father used to say.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, neighbour Spokeum, it is much easier for fools to laugh at a proposed
          invention than to understand it when done.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Ay, sir, that&rsquo;s true enough: only that we projectors should not tell our secrets, I could show
          you the whole contrivance with seventeen wheels, and&mdash;</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>No, no, we don&rsquo;t wish to forestall you, or to put you out of heart.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Who have laughed at you most? do I know any of the parties?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Why there is the Thatcher, and he, you know, is a bit of a poet: he wants to set me about a
          contrivance to cut moonshine into slices! I don&rsquo;t know what to say to him; I am afraid he is too great a fool for anything.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Don&rsquo;t mind him, then; that is your only defence.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>But I have silenced another of my tormentors completely, by just turning round upon him with a
          few words.&mdash;You know the justice&rsquo;s clerk in the next village?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>Know him, yes; he sets wheels to work too, but they will do more mischief than yours.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Well, sir, he wanted to know if I could not invent a machine to make lawyers honest.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>A very desirable thing, certainly.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>And what could you say to him?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>O sir, very little, sir; but it came out in a minute&mdash;it came of itself. Says I, that machine has
          been invented long before we were born, and I have only to take pattern by one that has stood up on our common for these forty years; it
          only consists of two strong upright posts, with a cross bar at the top&mdash;you understand me, gentlemen.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Why, Spokeum, you are a wit, and half a wag too, I perceive.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Ay, sir, they all set up a loud laugh, not at &lsquo;Old Hops,&rsquo; as they call me, but at the lawyer. I
          think I was &lsquo;down upon him&rsquo; there, as my father used to say.&mdash;Knock your foes down one at a time, that&rsquo;s the way to settle them.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>But what can you do when they make you angry? for all silly cunning-headed banterers try at that
          first.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Sir, I defy them to make me angry, unless they speak slightingly of my son Joel; that I can&rsquo;t
          bear at all! Why, gentlemen, my son Joel and I, and your honours, are the cleverest men in these two parishes.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Thank you, Spokeum, for the honour you do us.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Now indeed, your honour, I don&rsquo;t want to give offence, for I know it to be true.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>You are not likely to give offence, man; but we must leave you rather abruptly, for we are
          engaged at the hall.&mdash;Remember what I told you; get your money of the housekeeper before you go home.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Spok. </em>Thank you, sir.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mor. </em>And, Spokeum, don&rsquo;t you spare them an inch; a repartee is often better than a cudgel.</p>

          whatever be the cause of your uneasiness.&mdash;So, Mary <em xmlns="">(addressing her)</em>, you have been in the wars, I hear! What, neither
          killed nor taken prisoner, ha? I have heard all about it. O, these whirlwinds are terrible things to encounter! I have seen a whirlwind take
          an oak by the top, and shiver him down to his very root like a whisp of grass!</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>That must have been a terrible sight indeed, sir; but, in your instance, it was the whirlwind
          struck the oak; in mine, it was the oak struck the whirlwind, for Joel was there.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Well said, child; it was nobly done, and I like the young fellow all the better for it: he

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Gold. </em>Ay, very true, my lady; for there is a charming echo down by the forest side, and &lsquo;<em xmlns="">Who but happy Donald.</em>&rsquo;</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Mary. </em>Begging your pardon, sir, Donald, as you call him, is not a Jack Whirlwind, so that our cases are

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Lady H. </em>But what is all this to us? Do you think it worth crying about?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Betty. </em>But, my Lady, the worst of it is to come: I have been churning the whole morning, and cannot get
          a mite of butter!&mdash;But I know the reason well enough.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Emma. </em>Then be so good as to tell us, for I can make nothing of you yet.</p>

        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Betty. </em>Now, there lies the misfortune; for master don&rsquo;t believe in witchcraft, and so I must lose my
          place. But, madam, as I passed old Nan Barret yesterday, with my new bonnet on, she gave me such an evil look, as would have spoiled all the
          cream in the county. I was sure that mischief would follow. A spiteful old creature! she looks as though she had never been young; and I am
          sure she never could have been handsome, for all the children in the parish are afraid of her.&mdash;Do pray speak for me, madam; for I never was
          so full of trouble in my life <em xmlns="">(Weeping)</em>.</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Emma. </em>Now, go along, you simpleton, and I promise you my entire interest in your behalf.</p>

          landed, the plague broke out, the army revolted, or some other national calamity had befallen us?</p>
        <p class="indent1 "><em xmlns="">Emma. </em>Well, but, dear sir, in any one of these cases, as in this, your man, John, must have been
          concerned, and Betty seems to live for nobody else.</p>

        <p class="indent0 ">Bloomfield&rsquo;s second children&rsquo;s book, written jointly with his son <a class="link_ref" type="m" href="../people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> who was training to be schoolmaster in London and    Kent, was in progress by autumn 1822. On 28 October (<a class="link_ref" href="../letterEEd.25.364.html" title="Letter 364">Letter 364</a>), Bloomfield advised his son &lsquo;do     not fail to send me whatever you may have written, I mean <em xmlns="">all</em> that you have written about the &ldquo;Birds and Insects&rdquo; that  I may shew Mr Harvey a specimen of the work at Christmas if possible . . . I do what I can at it&rsquo;. Harvey was the bookseller who specialised    in children&rsquo;s literature and who had published <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The History of Little Davy&rsquo;s New Hat. </span>Bloomfield, however, was sick and   depressed, and in a sad letter begun on 23 December 1822 but not finished until 1 February 1823 (<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="link_ref" href="../letterEEd.25.366.html" title="Letter 366">Letter 366</a>) confesses he has not yet sent the    manuscript to Harvey. On 2 May 1823 he told Charles that &lsquo;I have written more letters for our &ldquo;post Office&rdquo;and think it will do well    considered as a minor concern in our persuits&rsquo; (<a class="link_ref" href="../letterEEd.25.369.html" title="Letter 369">Letter 369</a>), but it remained unpublished at his death in August: no deal with Darton and Harvey was done. The work appeared in 1824     in <span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Remains of Robert Bloomfield</span>, edited by Bloomfield&rsquo;s friend Joseph Weston and published for the benefit of  Bloomfield&rsquo;s family by Baldwin, Cradock and Joy.</p>
        <p class="indent0 "><span xmlns="" class="titlem">The Birds&rsquo; and Insects&rsquo; Post Office </span>is a delightful text book for children, teaching natural history and   moral conduct by using the charming conceit of having birds and insects write letters to each other: exactly the kind of gentle humour at which Bloomfield excels. As Bridget Keegan has shown, it follows in a tradition dating back to Aesop but more recently revived by the   children&rsquo;s writers whom he credited in the Preface to <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Little Davy</span>&mdash;Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Sarah Trimmer among them:   &lsquo;Bloomfield&rsquo;s prefatory remarks are comparable to those of many Romantic-period children&rsquo;s writers, such as Sarah Trimmer, who writes in the    introduction to her The History of Robins (first published as <span xmlns="" class="titlem">Fabulous Histories</span> in 1786) that it should be taken &ldquo;not as    containing the real conversation of birds, (for that is impossible we should ever understand) but as a series of fables intended to convey     moral instructions applicable to themselves&rdquo;&rsquo;. <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#1">[1]</a><a name="1back">&nbsp;</a> Bloomfield&rsquo;s text, it should be     noted, is full of detailed observation of fauna in its habitat: it is for that reason less ostensible in its moral didacticism than   Trimmer&rsquo;s work.</p>

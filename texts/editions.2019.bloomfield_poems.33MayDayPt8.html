        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 "><span xmlns="" class="smallcaps">Yes</span>, let me tell of Jennet, my last child;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">In her the charms of all the rest ran wild,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And sprouted as they pleased. Still by my side,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I own she was my favourite, was my pride, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Since first she labour&rsquo;d round my neck to twine,<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Or clasp&rsquo;d both little hands in one of mine:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And when the season broke, I&rsquo;ve seen her bring</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Lapfuls of flowers, and then the girl would sing</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Whole songs, and halves, and bits, O, with such glee!</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">If playmates found a favourite, it was she.<span class="lineNumber">10</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Her lively spirit lifted her to joy;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To distance in the race a clumsy boy</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Would raise the flush of conquest in her eye,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And all was dance, and laugh, and liberty.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Yet not hard-hearted, take me right, I beg,<span class="lineNumber">15</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The veriest romp that ever wagg&rsquo;d a leg</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Was Jennet; but when pity soothed her mind,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Prompt with her tears, and delicately kind.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The half-fledged nestling, rabbit, mouse, or dove, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">By turns engaged her cares and infant love;<span class="lineNumber">20</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And many a one, at the last doubtful strife,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Warm&rsquo;d in her bosom, started into life.</div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">At thirteen she was all that Heaven could send,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">My nurse, my faithful clerk, my lively friend;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Last at my pillow when I sunk to sleep,<span class="lineNumber">25</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">First on my threshold soon as day could peep:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I heard her happy to her heart&rsquo;s desire,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">With clanking pattens, and a roaring fire.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Then, having store of new-laid eggs to spare, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She fill&rsquo;d her basket with the simple fare,<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And weekly trudged (I think I see her still)</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To sell them at yon house upon the hill.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Oft have I watch&rsquo;d her as she stroll&rsquo;d along,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Heard the gate bang, and heard her morning song;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And, as my warm ungovern&rsquo;d feelings rose,<span class="lineNumber">35</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Said to myself, &lsquo;Heaven bless her! there she goes.&rsquo;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Long would she tarry, and then dancing home,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Tell how the lady bade her oft&rsquo;ner come,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And bade her talk and laugh without control;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For Jennet&rsquo;s voice was music to the soul,<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">My tale shall prove it:&mdash;For there dwelt a son,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">An only child, and where there is but one,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Indulgence like a mildew reigns, from whence</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Mischief may follow if that child wants sense. </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But Alfred was a youth of noble mind,<span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">With ardent passions, and with taste refined:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">All that could please still courted heart and hand,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Music, joy, peace, and wealth, at his command;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Wealth, which his widow&rsquo;d mother deem&rsquo;d his own;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Except the poor, she lived for him alone.<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Yet would she weep by stealth when he was near,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But check&rsquo;d all sighs to spare his wounded ear;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For from his cradle he had never seen</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Soul-cheering sunbeams, or wild nature&rsquo;s green. </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But all life&rsquo;s blessings centre not in sight;<span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For Providence, that dealt him one long night,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Had given, in pity to the blooming boy,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Feelings more exquisitely tuned to joy.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Fond to excess was he of all that grew;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The morning blossom sprinkled o&rsquo;er with dew,<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Across his path, as if in playful freak,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Would dash his brow, and weep upon his cheek;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Each varying leaf that brush&rsquo;d where&rsquo;er he came,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Press&rsquo;d to his rosy lip he call&rsquo;d by name; </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">He grasp&rsquo;d the saplings, measured every bough,<span class="lineNumber">65</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Inhaled the fragrance that the spring months throw</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Profusely round, till his young heart confess&rsquo;d</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">That all was beauty, and himself was bless&rsquo;d.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Yet when he traced the wide extended plain, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Or clear brook side, he felt a transient pain;<span class="lineNumber">70</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The keen regret of goodness, void of pride,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To think he could not roam without a guide.</div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Who, guess ye, knew these scenes of home delight</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Better than Jennet, bless&rsquo;d with health and sight? </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Whene&rsquo;er she came, he from his sports would slide,<span class="lineNumber">75</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And catch her wild laugh, listening by her side;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Mount to the tell-tale clock with ardent spring,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And <em xmlns="">feel </em>the passing hour, then fondly cling</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To Jennet&rsquo;s arm, and tell how sweet the breath </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Of bright May-mornings on the open heath;<span class="lineNumber">80</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Then off they started, rambling far and wide,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Like Cupid with a wood-nymph by his side.</div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Thus months and months roll&rsquo;d on, the summer pass&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And the long darkness, and the winter blast, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Sever&rsquo;d the pair; no flowery fields to roam,<span class="lineNumber">85</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Poor Alfred sought his music and his home.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">What wonder then if inwardly he pined?</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The anxious mother mark&rsquo;d her stripling&rsquo;s mind</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Gloomy and sad, yet striving to be gay </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">As the long tedious evenings pass&rsquo;d away:<span class="lineNumber">90</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&rsquo;Twas her delight fresh spirits to supply.&mdash;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">My girl was sent for&mdash;just for company.</div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">A tender governess my daughter found,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Her temper placid, her instruction sound; </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Plain were her precepts, full of strength, their power<span class="lineNumber">95</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Was founded on the practice of the hour:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Theirs were the happy nights to peace resign&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">With ample means to cheer th&rsquo; unbended mind.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The Sacred History, or the volumes fraught</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">With tenderest sympathy, or towering thought,<span class="lineNumber">100</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The laughter-stirring tale, the moral lay,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">All that brings dawning reason into day.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">There Jennet learn&rsquo;d by maps, through every land</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To travel, and to name them at command; </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Would tell how great their strength, their bounds how far,<span class="lineNumber">105</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And show where uncle Charles was in the war.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The globe she managed with a timid hand,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Told which was ocean, which was solid land,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And said, whate&rsquo;er their diff &lsquo;rent climates bore,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">All still roll&rsquo;d round, though that I knew before.<span class="lineNumber">110</span></div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Thus grown familiar, and at perfect ease,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">What could be Jennet&rsquo;s duty but to please?</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Yet hitherto she kept, scarce knowing why,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">One powerful charm reserved, and still was shy. </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">When Alfred from his grand-piano drew<span class="lineNumber">115</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Those heavenly sounds that seem&rsquo;d for ever new,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She sat as if to sing would be a crime,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And only gazed with joy, and nodded time.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Till one snug evening, I myself was there,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The whispering lad inquired, behind my chair,<span class="lineNumber">120</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Bowman, can Jennet sing?&rsquo; &lsquo;At home,&rsquo; said I,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;She sings from morn till night, and seems to fly</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">From tune to tune, the sad, the wild, the merry,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And moulds her lip to suit them like a cherry; </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She learn&rsquo;d them here.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;O ho!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;O ho!&rsquo;<span class="lineNumber">125</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And rubb&rsquo;d his hands, and stroked his forehead, so.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Then down he sat, sought out a tender strain,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Sung the first words, then struck the chords again;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Come, Jennet, help me, you <em xmlns="">must </em>know this song</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Which I have sung, and you have heard so long.&rsquo;<span class="lineNumber">130</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I mark&rsquo;d the palpitation of her heart,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Yet she complied, and strove to take a part,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But faint and fluttering, swelling by degrees,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Ere self-composure gave that perfect ease, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The soul of song:&mdash;then, with triumphant glee,<span class="lineNumber">135</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Resting her idle work upon her knee,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Her little tongue soon fill&rsquo;d the room around</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">With such a voluble and magic sound,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">That, &rsquo;spite of all her pains to persevere, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She stopp&rsquo;d to sigh, and wipe a starting tear;<span class="lineNumber">140</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Then roused herself for faults to make amends,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">While Alfred trembled to his fingers&rsquo; ends.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But when this storm of feeling sunk to rest,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Jennet, resuming, sung her very best, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And on the ear, with many a dying fall,<span class="lineNumber">145</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She pour&rsquo;d th&rsquo; enchanting &lsquo;Harp of Tara&rsquo;s Hall.&rsquo; <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="1back">&nbsp;</a></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Still Alfred hid his raptures from her view,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Still touch&rsquo;d the keys, those raptures to renew,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And led her on to that sweet past&rsquo;ral air, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The Highland Laddie with the yellow hair. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="2back">&nbsp;</a><span class="lineNumber">150</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She caught the sound, and with the utmost ease</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Bade nature&rsquo;s music triumph, sure to please:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Such truth, such warmth, such tenderness express&rsquo;d,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">That my old heart was dancing in my breast. </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Upsprung the youth, &lsquo;O Jennet, where&rsquo;s your hand?<span class="lineNumber">155</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">There&rsquo;s not another girl in all the land,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">If she could bring me empires, bring me sight,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Could give me such unspeakable delight:</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">You little baggage! not to tell before</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">That you could sing; mind you go home no more.&rsquo;<span class="lineNumber">160</span></div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Thus I have seen her from my own fire-side</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Attain the utmost summit of her pride;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For, from that singing hour, as time roll&rsquo;d round,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">At the great house my Jennet might be found, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And, while I watch&rsquo;d her progress with delight,<span class="lineNumber">165</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She had a father&rsquo;s blessing every night,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And grew in knowledge at that moral school</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Till I began to guess myself a fool.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Music! why she could play as well as he!</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">At least I thought so,&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll let that be:<span class="lineNumber">170</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She read the poets, grave and light, by turns,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And talk&rsquo;d of Cowper&rsquo;s &lsquo;Task,&rsquo;<a href="#3">&nbsp;[3]</a><a name="3back">&nbsp;</a> and Robin <a class="link_ref" type="m" href="../people.html#BurnsRobert" title="Burns">Burns</a>;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Nay, read without a book, as I may say,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">As much as some could with in half a day. </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&rsquo;Twas thus I found they pass&rsquo;d their happy time,<span class="lineNumber">175</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">In all their walks, when nature in her prime</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Spread forth her scents and hues, and whisper&rsquo;d love</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And joy to every bird in every grove;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And though their colours could not meet his eye, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She pluck&rsquo;d him flowers, then talk&rsquo;d of poetry.<span class="lineNumber">180</span></div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="indent4 ">Once on a sunbright morning, &rsquo;twas in June,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I felt my spirits and my hopes in tune,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And idly rambled forth, as if t&rsquo; explore</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The little valley just before my door; </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Down by yon dark green oak I found a seat<span class="lineNumber">185</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Beneath the clustering thorns, a snug retreat</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For poets, as I deem&rsquo;d, who often prize</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Such holes and corners far from human eyes;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I mark&rsquo;d young Alfred, led by Jennet, stray</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Just to the spot, both chatting on their way:<span class="lineNumber">190</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">They came behind me, I was still unseen;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">He was the elder, Jennet was sixteen.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">My heart misgave me, lest I should be deem&rsquo;d</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">A prying listener, never much esteem&rsquo;d, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">But this fear soon subsided, and I said,<span class="lineNumber">195</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hear this blind lad and my little maid.&rsquo;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">That instant down she pluck&rsquo;d a woodbine wreath,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The loose leaves rattled on my head beneath;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">This was for Alfred, which he seized with joy,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;O, thank you, Jennet,&rsquo; said the generous boy.<span class="lineNumber">200</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Much was their talk, which many a theme supplied,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">As down they sat, for every blade was dried.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I would have skulk&rsquo;d away, but dare not move,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;they will not talk of love;&rsquo;</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">And ugly too, I&rsquo;m certain, by his voice,</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">I cannot hide my face from all the men;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Alfred, indeed, indeed, you are deceived,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">He never spoke a word that I believed;<span class="lineNumber">220</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Nay, can he think that I would leave a home</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Full of enjoyment, present, and to come,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">While your dear mother&rsquo;s favours daily prove</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">&rsquo;Midst her old friends, my poultry, and my flowers.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She came,&mdash;but not till fatal news had wrung<span class="lineNumber">285</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Her heart through sleepless hours, and chain&rsquo;d her tongue.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She came, but with a look that gave me pain,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For, though bright sunbeams sparkled after rain,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Though every brood came round, half run, half fly,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I knew her anguish by her alter&rsquo;d eye;<span class="lineNumber">290</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And strove, with all my power, where&rsquo;er she came,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To soothe her grief, yet gave it not a name.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">At length a few sad bitter tears she shed,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And on both hands reclined her aching head.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&rsquo;Twas then my time the conqueror to prove,<span class="lineNumber">295</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I summon&rsquo;d all my rhetoric, all my love.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Jennet, you must not think to pass through life</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">Thus I went on, trite moral truths to string,&mdash;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">All chaff, mere chaff, where love has spread his wing:</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">What was my aim, but wiped her burning brow, </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Where sat more eloquence and living power<span class="lineNumber">305</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Than language could embody in an hour.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">With soften&rsquo;d tone I mention&rsquo;d Alfred&rsquo;s name,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">His wealth, our poverty, and that sad blame</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">And should I leave him now, or seem unkind,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">The thought would surely wreck his noble mind;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">To leave him thus, and in his utmost need! </div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Poor Alfred! then you will be blind indeed!<span class="lineNumber">330</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I will not leave him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nay, child, do not rave,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">What, would you be his menial, be his slave?&rsquo;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she exclaim&rsquo;d, and wiped each streaming eye,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Yes, be his slave, and serve him till I die;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">He is too just to act the tyrant&rsquo;s part,<span class="lineNumber">335</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">He&rsquo;s truth itself.&rsquo; O how my burthen&rsquo;d heart</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Sigh&rsquo;d for relief!&mdash;soon that relief was found;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Without one word we traced the meadow round,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Her feverish hand in mine, and weigh&rsquo;d the case,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Nor dared to look each other in the face;<span class="lineNumber">340</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Till, with a sudden stop, as if from fear,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">I roused her sinking spirit, &lsquo;Who comes here?&rsquo;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Down the green slope before us, glowing warm,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Came Alfred, tugging at his mother&rsquo;s arm;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Willing she seem&rsquo;d, but he still led the way,<span class="lineNumber">345</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">She had not walk&rsquo;d so fast for many a day;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">His hand was lifted, and his brow was bare,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">For now no clust&rsquo;ring ringlets wanton&rsquo;d there,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">He threw them back in anger and in spleen,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And shouted &lsquo;Jennet&rsquo; o&rsquo;er the daisied green.<span class="lineNumber">350</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Boyish impatience strove with manly grace</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">In ev&rsquo;ry line and feature of his face;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">His claim appear&rsquo;d resistless as his choice,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And when he caught the sound of Jennet&rsquo;s voice,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And when with spotless soul he clasp&rsquo;d the maid,<span class="lineNumber">355</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">My heart exulted while my breath was staid.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Jennet, we must not part! return again;</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">What have I done to merit all this pain?</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">To such appeals all prompt replies are cold,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And stately prudence snaps her cobweb hold.</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Had the good widow tried, or wish&rsquo;d to speak,</div>

          <div class="indent4 ">Bore off his prize, and fancied every charm,<span class="lineNumber">375</span></div>

          <div class="indent4 ">Completely conquer&rsquo;d, Love the day had won,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And the young vagrant triumph&rsquo;d in our plight,</div>
          <div class="indent4 ">And shook his roguish plumes, and laugh&rsquo;d outright.<span class="lineNumber">380</span></div>
          <div class="indent4 ">Yet, by my life and hopes, I would not part</div>

            <div class="indent4 ">The very dress which, sixty years before,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Had sparkled on her sunshine bridal morn,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Had sparkled, ay, beneath this very thorn!<span class="lineNumber">30</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Her hair was snowy white, o&rsquo;er which was seen,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Emblem of what her bridal cheeks had been, </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">A twin red rose&mdash;no other ornament</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Had pride suggested, or false feeling lent;</div>

            <div class="indent4 ">Nine ruddy lasses follow&rsquo;d where she stepp&rsquo;d; </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">White were their virgin robes, that lightly swept</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The downy grass; in every laughing eye</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Cupid had skulk&rsquo;d, and written &lsquo;victory.&rsquo;<span class="lineNumber">40</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">What heart on earth its homage could refuse?</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Each tripp&rsquo;d, unconsciously, a blushing Muse.</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">A slender chaplet of fresh blossoms bound</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Their clustering ringlets in a magic round.</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And, as they slowly moved across the green,<span class="lineNumber">45</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Each in her beauty seem&rsquo;d a May-day queen.</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The first a wreath bore in her outstretch&rsquo;d hand, </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The rest a single rose upon a wand;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Their steps were measured to that grassy throne</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Where, watching them, Sir Ambrose sat alone.<span class="lineNumber">50</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">They stopp&rsquo;d,&mdash;when she, the foremost of the row,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Curtsied, and placed the wreath upon his brow; </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The rest, in order pacing by his bower,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">In the loop&rsquo;d wreath left each her single flower,&mdash;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Then stood aside.&mdash;What broke the scene&rsquo;s repose?<span class="lineNumber">55</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The whole assembly clapp&rsquo;d their hands and rose.</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The Muses charm&rsquo;d them as they form&rsquo;d a ring, </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And look&rsquo;d the very life and soul of Spring!</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">But still the white hair&rsquo;d dame they view&rsquo;d with pride,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Her love so perfect, and her truth so tried.<span class="lineNumber">60</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Oh, sweet it is to hear, to see, to name,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Unquench&rsquo;d affection in the palsied frame&mdash; </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">To think upon the boundless raptures past,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And love, triumphant, conquering to the last!</div>
          </div><br>
          <div class="stanza">
            <div class="indent4 ">Silenced by feeling, vanquish&rsquo;d by his tears,<span class="lineNumber">65</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The host sprung up, nor felt the weight of years;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Yet utterance found not, though in virtue&rsquo;s cause, </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">But acclamations fill&rsquo;d up nature&rsquo;s pause,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Till, by one last and vigorous essay,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">His tide of feeling roll&rsquo;d itself away;<span class="lineNumber">70</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The language of delight its bondage broke,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And many a warm heart bless&rsquo;d him as he spoke. </div>
          </div><br>

            <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Neighbours and friends, by long experience proved,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Pardon this weakness; I was too much moved:</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">My dame, you see, can youth and age insnare,<span class="lineNumber">75</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">In vain I strove, &rsquo;twas more than I could bear,&mdash;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Yet hear me,&mdash;though the tyrant passions strive, </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The words of truth, like leading stars, survive;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">I thank you all, but will accomplish more,&mdash;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Your verses shall not die as heretofore;<span class="lineNumber">80</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Your local tales shall not be thrown away,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Nor war remain the theme of every lay. </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Ours is an humbler task, that may release</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The high-wrought soul, and mould it into peace.</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">These pastoral notes some victor&rsquo;s ear may fill,<span class="lineNumber">85</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Breathed amidst blossoms, where the drum is still:</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">I purpose then to send them forth to try </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The public patience, or its apathy.</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The world shall see them; why should I refrain?</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">&rsquo;Tis all the produce of my own domain.<span class="lineNumber">90</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Farewell!&rsquo; he said, then took his lady&rsquo;s arm,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">On his shrunk hand her starting tears fell warm; </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Again he turn&rsquo;d to view the happy crowd,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And cried, &lsquo;Good night, good night, good night,&rsquo; aloud,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Health to you all! for see, the evening closes,&rsquo;<span class="lineNumber">95</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Then march&rsquo;d to rest, beneath his crown of roses.</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">&lsquo;Happy old man! with feelings such as these, </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The seasons all can charm, and trifles please.&rsquo;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">An instantaneous shout re-echoed round,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">&rsquo;Twas wine and gratitude inspired the sound:<span class="lineNumber">100</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Some joyous souls resumed the dance again,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The aged loiter&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the homeward plain,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And scatter&rsquo;d lovers rambled through the park,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And breathed their vows of honour in the dark;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Others a festal harmony preferr&rsquo;d,<span class="lineNumber">105</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Still round the thorn the jovial song was heard;</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Dance, rhymes, and fame, they scorn&rsquo;d such things as these, </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">But drain&rsquo;d the mouldy barrel to its lees,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">As if &rsquo;twere worse than shame to want repose:</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Nor was the lawn clear till the moon arose,<span class="lineNumber">110</span></div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And on each turret pour&rsquo;d a brilliant gleam</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">Of modest light, that trembled on the stream; </div>
            <div class="indent4 ">The owl awoke, but dared not yet complain,</div>
            <div class="indent4 ">And banish&rsquo;d silence re-assumed her reign.</div>

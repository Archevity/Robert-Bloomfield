        <p class="right ">Wednesday-night, Dec. 28&ndash;91.</p>
        <p class="indent0 ">HON. FATHER,</p>
        <p class="indent0 ">It would have been a great pleasure to us both to have met you at Mr. Wyatt&rsquo;s this time, and we were only prevented by    visitors, who came quite unexpected. You would have liked to have seen our little one; and I hope you will yet, before long. We thank you    for all your kindness, and as I am endeavouring to get into business for myself, I sincerely hope, to have it in my power, to entertain you  better when you come. I have an undeniable chance. I have some good customers, and might have enough immediately, to provide a genteel living for <a class="link_ref" type="m" href="../people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="my wife">my wife</a> and <a class="link_ref" type="m" href="../people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="child">child</a>, if I could take advantage of it soon. If I could get three months credit at my leather-cutters, for five or six pounds only, it   would enable me to give credit to that amount, as my custom lies among such, as are able and willing to improve it: but I am determined to  carry it on as well as I can. </p>
        <p class="indent0 ">The underwritten lines, contain the sentiments, which always occur to my mind when I come to Woolwich; and as I put them into metre when the Boyne was launched, and they are still perfect on my mind, I write them now, because I think you have a relish for such  things, particularly the devotional parts of them.</p>
        <p class="indent0 ">Before I was married, I often amused myself with such compositions, and had several pieces published in newspapers, magazines, &amp;; but I find other employment now, which is of equal pleasure to me.</p>
        <p class="indent0 ">My Polly and the child are in good health, and I hope to hear from you soon; and remain yours, in duty and affection, </p>

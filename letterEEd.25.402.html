                    make up his statement of the 'remains'—I accordingly went to him on Friday                    afternoon and had a long conference on the subject of your affairs. I was sorry
                    to find in spite of all our efforts, the whole of the Works have had of late a                    very dull sale. The 'Remains' have not yet paid the expense of publication.
                    There are almost 400 or 500 of the Farmers Boy in stock which will not suffice                    for the demand till the copyright of that work expires—but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Mr Baldwin">Mr Baldwin</a> says that it would not                    answer to publish it again in the present form because as soon as the copyright
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">has</em> expired it will be printed by others in two                    different forms—first in a highly embellished and expensive form, which has now                    become very fashionable in other works, and secondly in a cheap edition to sell                    at about a pr volume.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> He says that this ought to be anticipated by those who have an                    interest in the works &amp; that he would have no objection on his own      part—and thinks the rest of those who share in the copyright would also be
                    willing to join the family in publishing in both these ways <em>but</em> that as the expence will be so considerable &amp; as their
                    share is so small (viz an eighth) and as they have already advanced so much                    beyond their receipt he should not be willing to advance money for the family
                    and moreover that as the periods of copyright on the 'rural Tales' &amp;                    'Wild Flowers' (the only <em>selling</em> books) will expire so soon                    after he thinks it advisable to publish the whole of these works in the same                    manner—and that if the family are unable to raise means for the purpose it would
                    perhaps be better to sell their copyrights than to let their interest in the                    works perish for want of properly sustaining it.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I told him he might if he pleased send in a proposition to me,                    which should include the whole of the copyright &amp; the whole of the stock
                    of all the works already published, with all the contingencies belonging to                    them—that I thought you would be influenced by what I might think of the terms                    and that if they seem'd to me fair and liberal, I should submit them to the                    consideration of the family.—</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> This he promised to do, and I have thought it right to give you                    timely intimation in order that you may consult together and well consider the                    subject—If a wish exists in the family to part with the copyrights, it can be
                    done now on terms (I suppose) quite as advantageous as at any previous time, and                    there may seem to be an additional motive in the circumstances stated by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Mr Baldwin">Mr Baldwin</a> and in the destitute                    condition of the family.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have stated these matters as clearly as I can, without                    presuming to advise either one way or the other, and remain yours truly</p><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Jos Weston">Jos Weston</a></p>

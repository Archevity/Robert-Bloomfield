		<br/><div class="letter"><h3>397. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah Bloomfield">Hannah Bloomfield</a> to 'A       Lady', undated, after 28 June 1824<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p class="pnonident">Madam,</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have been so much employed by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a> during the last week in
                    making extracts from letters and writing out copy for the press, that I fear I
                    have transgressed the rules of strict propriety in having omitted to reply to
                    your kind letter. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a>, the    friend who has taken the trouble to manage our concerns, has consulted some of
                    my father's best and oldest friends as to the merits of the work to be   published. It has met with their approbation, and will make its appearance now  in a few days, and I trust will rather contribute to establish my dear father's    fame than to diminish it.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> It was the opinion of our friends near <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>, that we ought to avail
                    ourselves of the sympathy which our misfortunes had excited as soon as we
                    decently could, particularly as the first fruits arising from this resource
                    cannot reach us under fourteen or fifteen months, unless we had consented to
                    sacrifice a great part of the advantage (which may arise from the work being
                    sold for our exclusive benefit) for the sake of raising a present supply. I am
                    at a loss to know what are the liberal and handsome gifts to which you have
                    alluded, as having been made at our sale. A gentleman, whom it would perhaps be
                    improper to name, was so kind as to purchase the oak table which sold for £13.,
                    and presented it as an heirloom of the family. Another gentleman purchased a
                    pewter dish for £1. 1s., which he also presented. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DrakeNathan" title="Dr. Drake">Dr. Drake</a> sent spontaneously a  subscription raised among his friends at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Hadleigh" title="Hadleigh">Hadleigh</a>, amounting to £13. 2s. 6d., besides which I do not remember  any other favour except the drawings which you, madam, was so kind as to  purchase so much above their value. Perhaps you will more readily believe me on
                    this point, when I inform you, that the clear proceeds of our sale amounted only
                    to £82.; and that when we had paid our creditors and our expense to London, we
                    had about £40. left to divide amongst five of us, to supply our expenditure for
                    about two years, as we must wait full that time before our bookseller's account
                    becomes reproductive.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The subscription has been managed by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RogersSamuel" title="Mr. Rogers">Mr. Rogers</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Mr. Park">Mr. Park</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a>, who have caused
                    circulars to be distributed amongst our friends in all parts of the country, and
                    I am sure it would be much regretted by those gentlemen if this has been done in
                    any way unpleasant to our friends.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> When I mentioned to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr.
                        Weston</a> what you have observed about the variety of the modes employed
                    to interest the public in our behalf, he replied,—some will assist from one
                    motive and some from another; but reflecting minds will in general feel more
                    disposed to help you in proportion as they observe in you a willingness to help
                    yourselves, and to make the most of the little property which is still in your
                    possession.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> My father's manuscripts were bought in at the sale by ourselves,
                    lest a dispute should arise as to the right of publishing them.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><span xmlns="" id="index.xml-label-N19601A8"><!--anchor--></span>P.S. I have taken the liberty of reading your letter, and this     answer of mine to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a>. He                  says it will be of infinite importance to us to have extracts from them,                    published in the forthcoming work. The reason he assigns is, that others may be                    influenced by the same opinions which you have expressed, and it is of                    consequence to us that our friends should not remain under erroneous
                    impressions.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a> has transcribed that                    part of yours which he thinks available, and marked the corresponding part of                    mine. If you are so kind as to comply, I shall feel obliged by an immediate                    answer, it being the only thing for which we shall have to wait.</p>

                        1802<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">London.  Nov 1<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup> 1802</p><p class="pnonident">Dear George</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have been writing the enclosed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a>, to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> and to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a>, and now it
                    is your turn.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> One of Corley's sons brought me a packet containing a Vollm of Gregory's Oeconomy of Nature,<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> which was at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a>, and I
                    now send the second Vollm.—I had a letter of Lamentation from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a>, and one
                    from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> by which I can find that much unhappiness must have been felt by
                    you all. The Irishman when he was going to be tried for horsestealing observed as he enterd the court 'Now here they are going to
                    make a Hundred words about this D——d Old Horse.' If he had seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverJohn" title="my Father">my Father</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> begining to strip the Thatch off he might have used the same
                    observation with the alteration of one word. On so delicate a subject as a family squabble how can I advise? What I have written
                    to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a> is my best answer to it all. And realy it is destressing that she
                    should be made to feel more than her natural temper may subject her to, either by the effects of poverty in one Son or the Worlds
                    crosses in another, for I realy suspect that you felt, and still feel some pressure of trouble that is unknown to me. Speak
                    ingenuously, have you any <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">other</em> objection to my standing the whole expense besides that of its being <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">expensive</em> and appearing in you eyes unfair?? Or do my part of the business appear like swallowing the House,
                    Tiles and all, against your will? I don't want the House! I only say that nobody out of the family shall have it if I can help it.
                    and this, with your permission, I will stick to. In thus looking forward you cannot pretend to set bounds to my Fancy nor I to
                    yours. suppose I say that, 'twenty years hence I mean to buy what <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">was </em><a class="link_ref" href="places.html#HoningtonGreen" title="Honington Green">Honington Green</a> and throw it open and erect upon it a pedestal in honour of the pastoral Muse! This is dreaming with a
                    vengence; but if you dislike it you may say somthing to wake me. I have a great and an inexplicable veneration for the House and
                    the place of our birth. Trudge says to Inkle in the play—</p><div xmlns="" class="lg"><div class="indent4"> 'What!

                    wish, and it is a good wish, that you would all make peace; and trust to Heaven, and to the growth of your infant children for
                    joys to come, and for the expansion of brighter views. And to induce you to it I have to add, that it is the intention of the
                    Booksellers, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomasN" title="Longman">Longman</a>
                    &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ReesOwen" title="Rees">Rees</a>, to better my last bargain as to 'Rural Tales,' which was made under
                    disadvantageous circumstances as you well know, by the further compliment of £100, in consequence of their great sale. As this is
                    but a verbal promise I say nothing of it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a>. You will find that I have given
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="Mr Austin">Mr Austin</a> an assurance by the enclosed Note to him, and under all these
                    circumstances I trust with a strengthened confidence in the ultimate triumph of affection over the yowls of our bosom pride, and

                    fill this sheet with the poetical notions which I believe I mentioned in my
                    last.</p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I send you a feast from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a>, but I cannot begrudge you the pleasure which I have had before
                    you. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GedgePeter" title="Mr Gedge">Mr Gedge</a> no doubt will show you the plate of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#HoningtonGreen" title="Honington Green">Honington Green</a>; I had two this
                    morning from Mr Hurst, and pointed out to them where either <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BlomfieldEdward" title="Mr B___">Mr B___</a> or the engraver had
                    misplaced the pantry window; they say it might be easily amended by punching
                    out, as it is called, and it will be a very popular and desirable ornament to a
                    Book of such admirable merit as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat's">Nat's</a> is likely to prove.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> Give my Love to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="Mother">Mother</a> and all friends; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> runs alone
                    strongly at sixteen months old, and is the treasure of our hearts, but to the
                    point.</p><p class="pnonident"> We all know that a good cook will reject such ingredients as he finds to have a
                    tendency to flatten his flavours and spoil his broth; so, in this sense of the
                    matter, there is an art in Poetry, though I do not like the expression. I mean
                    then to state what, according to my notion are bad ingredients in composition
                    and first, Inversion of Sentences, which may be instanced by recurring to a line
                    in the <cite>Rehearsal</cite>, by the Duke of Buckingham, 'And me her dear
                    parthenope she calls' now when this is rendered into plain English it is—'And
                    she calls me her dear Parthenope'.<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> Again, a less
                    violent inversion occurs in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DibdinCharles" title="Dibden's">Dibden's</a> Poor Jack—'Nought's a hardship from Duty that springs',<a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> that springs from duty—The more these are indulged in, the more
                    will appear the strain and endeavour after rhime, and the appearance of any
                    endeavour to accomplish that which is itself so secondary an object must be
                    wrong; besides there is much truth in Wordsworth's preface where he says that he
                    had tried to come near the language of Men, and the language of Men is not
                    backwards !<a href="#4"> [4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> I have a full
                    persuasion that this is the greatest blemish of many poems, and has often a
                    tendency to weaken the force of the line and diminish the ardour of the reader.
                    Milton, no doubt, has done it to advantage; and when there comes another Milton
                    he shall have my permission to do it too. Perhaps as inversions abound generally
                    in sonnets, it may be the principal cause of my disrelish for them.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The conclusion of poetical pieces, and the conclusion of sections
                    and divisions therein certainly ought to improve, line by line, so as to finish
                    with a twang, as the Boy said of his whip. A weak line at a close, is like a
                    dying note of a weak voice when it should be full and sonorous; and full of
                    soul; I could easily find instances but will leave the application to be made as
                    you read whatever may next come into your hand.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have perhaps an unfounded aversion to tying three lines
                    together in a measure where the ear expects but two. In Dryden's Virgil I find
                    it very frequent, and cannot see the advantage of it, you will of course not
                    wonder that there are none to be found in what I have ventured into the world;
                    and as I have thus far succeeded without, will not begin now.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The choice of phrases in Ballads and Songs, and perhaps more in
                    serious pieces, is of much importance; a common use of old worn out words I do
                    not like, such as erst, whilom, and a thousand more; and yet to take up and use
                    a word but just getting into circulation, newly adopted, or new coined, is like
                    placing a new bright penny piece among a range of old ones, it will look like a
                    broken rank, and besides run great hazard of rousing the risibility that arises
                    from contempt rather than the smile due to true humour, suppose by way of
                    illustrating this point, I had said originally in the Suffolk Ballad</p><div xmlns="" class="lg"><div class="l"> And laid aside her Lucks and twitches</div><div class="l"> And to the Hutch she reach'd her hand</div><div class="l"> And gave him out his Sunday <em xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">small-clothes</em>!<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#5"> [5]</a><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="back5"> </a></div></div><p class="pnonident">Perhaps <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeches</em> will one day be as old fashioned as doublet
                    and jerkin, as in another case though the song says 'With good old leathern
                    bottle, and ale that looks so brown'<a href="#6"> [6]</a><a name="back6"> </a> and yet I doubt that in another fifty years a
                    leather bottle will not be found but in the song.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Compound Epithets I do not much like; because they are often such
                    as we never use in conversation; there are three in my 'Word to the young
                        ladies'<a href="#7"> [7]</a><a name="back7"> </a> which I
                    deem such as are often used in conversation, 'full blown,' 'out-run' but
                    'half-expanded' is not so common. In a poem by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#OpieAmelia" title="Mrs. Opie">Mrs. Opie</a> I find the following which
                    are not used in conversation, Grief-impeded, fragrance-breathing, &amp;c and
                    I think many may be found in most poems, but I am only telling you my notions of
                    excellence, let every one chuse his own path.<a href="#8"> [8]</a><a name="back8"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Something of this kind may be traced in some pictures which I
                    have occasionally seen, which indeed relates more to the foregoing wrong
                    adaptation of words, than to compound epithets—A scene extremely rustic, the
                    Death of the Fox in a Cottage-yard would you there expect to see up against the
                    wall what in London are called Bird-bottles for the sparrows to build in?
                    Country people know sparrows too well; the same picture has the error of chimney
                    pots to the cottage, which I never saw in reality; these are London and Country
                    ideas mixed.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> With regard to Adulation, and short-lived subjects, you may, and
                    I know others <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">will</em> remark that out of all my numerous
                    friends, none have got even a Sonnet from me, flattery is a poor way of paying
                    debts, and as readers do not know the parties though the writer does, they
                    cannot feel as they would on general subjects; and as to their stability what do
                    we know of who were the friends of Cowley or Prior? or if we wish to know let us
                    know in prose where the authors have not the privelege of lying. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Duke of Grafton">Duke of Grafton</a> gave me
                    most fatherly advice on this head, which only would have given me an high
                    opinion of his sincerity and penetration.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I own that I have resolutely endeavoured to get at the disposal
                    of my own pieces, I have burnt several, and my proof of the wisdom of the deed
                    is by referring you to one which is now irrecoverable, a foolish story called
                    John Brown printed in the [MS torn], though I left it out of my collection, how
                    can I leave [MS torn] future collections when I am gone;—look sharp Robin.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Call this letter [Ms torn] my time is expired, and my pen weary

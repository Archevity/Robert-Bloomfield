					acknowledgement for yours of yesterday which had been expected with very great anxiety because we knew you to be awkwardly
					situated, and that it would require your whole stock of fortitude and experience to go through with it. I understand you have read
					that work of astonishing variety 'Gill Blas.' Now you may be either Gill, or Fabricious, or Scipio—but you will surely not have so
					many changes, or be <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">tempted</em> to change your situation so often.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> As to the present
						<a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Putney" title="Putney">Putney</a> concern it is evidenced that the subscribers and governers want to screw out of
					a new Master ten or twenty pounds which when divided would save each of them perhaps £2 per year or less / But now as to what we
					have to do with this beggarly spirit, is the point in hand.—You cannot go back to the Central it seems! On this I should say or
					surmise, that Johnson has already <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">there</em> some whom his <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">interest</em> prompts him to send
					before you; so much for that.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I don't think you are right in sticking for £70, for this reason, = because with <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">you</em> it is £70
					or nothing. Or at least you see you will have another plan to seek, though in this I by no means despair. I would by no means
					refuse £60 or even £55 (for a single man as you are,) and you see they are at their wits end to get one for more! But you are to
					understand this my advice on the supposition that you wish, or will, or <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">can</em>, put up with your <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Putney" title="Putney">Putney</a> station for a time.—I shall not be surprised at any sudden dismissal on their part,
					or at any disgust on yours, only particularly remember that your friend Mr Moor is not to be treated with any thing but that love
					and respect which your own heart, (I hope) dictates already.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I wish I was nearer to you, but pocket the £30 and wait events as I do.—I make rhimes when I can, and am not in
					despair. I shall soon see you altogether in London for better or worse, and in the mean time be what you have been, sober and
					discreet, and I shall be your Anxious Father</p><p align="right">Rob Bloomfield</p><p class="pnonident">When did you see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a>? We want to hear from her, perhaps she is 						very busy,? If not tell her to write.—</p>

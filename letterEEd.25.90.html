Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George Bloomfield">George

                    Mrs Palmer's letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> I did
                    not recolect that I could not forward a reply to Paris untill I have that letter
                    again, which contains that Lady's address there. I have written to Mrs Palmer,
                    and wish by some means you could contrive to get the letter from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Troston" title="Troston">Troston</a>, or only the address, that I may
                    avoid the appearance of disrespect to so good a friend by forwarding my Letter
                    immediately.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I hope <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> and
                    family are well, and should be very glad to hear from him, but amidst his
                    various engagements, and these busy times, I have perhaps no reason to
                    complain.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I expect <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ShieldWilliam" title="Mr Shield">Mr Shield</a>
                    on Sunday next. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The tide of popular hatred runs extreemly high against Justice

                        F</a> are extreemly plain in their language and virulent in their

                    know not how the poll stands; for there were contradictory reports last night,
                    and I have not seen a paper to day.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JennerEdward" title="Dr. Jenner">Dr.
                        Jenner</a>, and his kindness allmost induced me to shew him the little
                    progress I have made in pursuit of his subject; but I suddenly determined to the
                    contrary, and doubted of the propriety of so doing—your observations on the
                    possibility of my composing a pastoral Drama, and your hints as to proper
                    materials &amp;c., are extremely interesting. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ShieldWilliam" title="Mr Shield">Mr Shield</a> suggested that something
                    of that sort might be done. You have awakened the wish, rather than the hope of
                    ever succeeding in that line. What do I know about <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">stage
                        effect</em>? nevertheless, I have no doubt but I could tie a story together
                    that should speak my own sentiments and feelings, and of course you would like
                    to see it. You are I know well aware of how much depends on <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">choice of subject</em>.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I expect to go next week to my new employment.—</p><p class="pnonident">This moment a Letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JennerEdward" title="Dr Jenner">Dr Jenner</a>
                    invites me to tea this evening. what shall I do? leave 150 lines of an
                    unfinished subject in his hands? I am bound to consult <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> and the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Duke">Duke</a> and to submit my
                    pieces to their judgement; and never will do otherwise: and yet it is hard to
                    say <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">no</em> in such cases as this. I wish he would suspend his
                    curiosity 6 months, and I would take my chance. He is a very amiable man, and
                    perhaps rates my abilities too high. He is an enthusiast in his pursuit, and
                    well he may; when it is taken up by every country in Europe and by the poor
                    Cherokees of America. The blessing is surely immensely great!! and has features
                    of an uncommon kind; did you ever give it your serious consideration?? or am I
                    upon a wrong scent; do I</p><div xmlns="" class="lg"><div class="indent6"> '——fault'ring quit the pack,</div><div class="indent4"> Snuff the foul scent, and hasten yelping back'<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#2"> [2]</a><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" name="back2"> </a></div></div><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I pray God send it the confirmation of experiance! and the

                    reinforcement, a Corps de reserve, to the Bloomfield family; without the London
                    detachment knowing any thing of the matter; we hope to hear that all is going on
                    well; and that the junction has actually taken place, to the joy of your wife.

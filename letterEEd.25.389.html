The magazine man   mentioned by my brother Robert, was <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BentWilliam" title="Mr. W. Bent">Mr. W.    Bent</a>, successor to S. A. Cumberlege, at the Kings Arms,   Paternoster-row, London; but who was the editor of the magazine, I am ignorant.
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BentWilliam" title="Mr. Bent">Mr. Bent</a> was the publisher. His     was the Universal Magazine; I read it more than twenty years. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BentWilliam" title="Mr. Bent">Mr. Bent</a> kept the MS. a week or two,
                    and sent it back to my brother by a grave book-faced looking man, who said it did not suit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BentWilliam" title="Mr. Bent">Mr. Bent</a>, &amp;c.
                    My brother offered it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LaneWilliam" title="Mr. Lane">Mr. Lane</a>,   the great wholesale novel manufacturer. He returned it almost immediately with a
                    note of two lines, to say, it was not in his line. My brother afterwards left it
                    with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DillyCharles" title="Mr. Dilly">Mr. Dilly</a> in the Poultry. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DillyCharles" title="Mr. Dilly">Mr. Dilly</a>, when my brother   afterwards called for the MS. said it wanted revisal, &amp;c. My brother
                    then sent it to me here, at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a>,
                    and it was on my own petition, without my brother's knowledge, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft">Mr. Lofft</a> took it under his patronage.
                    But I have lived near seventy years in the world, and have seen enough of
                    mankind to know, that the wretch who has once vouched a falsehood, will invent
                    fifty more to make it good. Still, however, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft">Mr. Lofft</a>* is yet living, and will certainly prove he had no letter
                    of recommendation. But then the calumniator may still say he gave my brother
                    such letter. Should he do this, though I would stake my salvation on its being
                    false, how could it be disproved? The coward staid till the death of poor Robert
                    ere he dared make his attack. O, sir, if you could conceive how it hurt my mind
                    when I read the statement in the monthly Magazine for September 1823! ...</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The tale is told as if my brother's misfortunes arose from his
                    talents—as if his success had done no good—<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesBury" title="C. Bloomfield Esq.">C. Bloomfield Esq.</a> did not
                    know there was such a man as me in existence till Robert's success brought me to
                    his knowledge on Robert's account—for whose sake he, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesBury" title="Mr. B.">Mr. B.</a>, took me and mine
                    into his protection. His great benevolence and charity have conferred favours on
                    me it would fill a sheet to detail, and at this moment his bounty nearly feeds
                    me; but for Robert's success I should have been unknown to this gentleman and,
                    consequently, must have wanted bread, and have been in a workhouse. And poor
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="brother Isaac">brother Isaac</a>, who      was in his youth a gay lad, and on a footing with the young farmers of the
                    village must, when weighed down with a family of nine children, have trembled at
                    a vestry to those he once deemed his equals. But Robert took him up, and was his
                    true friend—took him and his family to London, and placed them in a shop. The
                    scheme failed—he sent them down again and gave them the rent in the cottage for
                    twenty years, clothed the boys, &amp;c. The rent alone must have been sixty
                    pounds. My brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a>, I doubt
                    not, had often his assistance. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a>
                    had thirteen or fourteen children. All the comforts myself and brothers enjoyed,
                    evidently sprung from the success of Robert. This sneaking assassin without a
                    name, who wrote the article for the Monthly Magazine for September, 1823, keeps
                    all this positive good—these real blessings out of sight— and tells us how happy
                    Robert might have been had he continued to be a journeyman shoemaker. Even here
                    he acts with cruel duplicity. He does not tell his readers that Robert was for
                    the last twenty years seldom capable of bodily labour. He leaves the reader to
                    think he was a man capable of hard exertion, whereas, the reverse was the case;
                    the suppression of truth is, in this case, as much a calumny as the fabrication
                    of falsehood.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> While his resources lasted, Robert was always ready to <em>prove by his conduct</em> that he acted to others as he would
                    have wished them to have acted towards him had <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">they</em> been in   his place and he in theirs. Here it may be objected, how came he to get into    debt? He certainly, while his income was good, had not that cold, prudential    caution which men of the world possess. I am willing to admit with that   calumniator, his ambition was disappointed. It would have been his ambition to   keep <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac's">Isaac's</a> family from   the parish; to keep his brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a> from trouble, &amp;c. &amp;c. This he could not do. But
                    to read the article in the Monthly Magazine, the reader might be led to think that he was ambitious of aping the man of '<em>pecuniary   independence, &amp;c.</em>'</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> The only luxury I ever knew him indulge in, was a Cockney garden;    and here he was more to be pitied than blamed. He staid some time after he came   into money in his old lodgings in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MulberryCourt" title="Mulberry-court">Mulberry-court</a>, till he was literally hunted out of it. Persons of consideration, who came in great numbers to see him, complained of the place   being disagreeable. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GedgePeter" title="Mr Peter Gedge">Mr Peter Gedge</a>,
                    the printer, called on him—gave him half-a-guinea, and advised him to get into a        better situation. Robert then hired a respectable lodging in Short-street,   Moorfields. His landlord put the key under the door in the night, and left  Robert to pay £9 rent to the proprietor of the house, or lose his goods. He then    hired a very small house near the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shepherd" title="Shepherd and Shepherdess">Shepherd and Shepherdess</a>, in the City Road. Here he had, what was certainly, a   large Cockney garden! When his income became reduced, he retired to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a>, where his rent, &amp;c.    was comparatively small. He never kept a servant, or a horse, as many a one
                    would have done. His whole conduct in prosperity proved his fraternal love, his  filial affection, and his readiness to assist to the utmost of his power those  who applied to him. Those who knew him best will wonder how a man so inoffensive and unobtrusive can be charged with ambition. But the writer of the article  above alluded to, says by <em> inference</em>, that the <em>poor</em> man of talents should not dare to enter the fields of  literature, but leave them to the men of '<em>pecuniary   independence</em>.'</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I hope, sir, you will not tire in the glorious work you have
                    begun. You cannot please every body—you cannot produce a perfect book:</p>

                        Bloomfield</a>, 15 June 1800<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">London.  Sunday, June 15<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1800</p><p class="pnonident">Dear George </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You must not expect a long epistle this time, I can only hallo to
                    you, like a coachman; talk flying. I have been this morning with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyCharles" title="Sir C. Bunbury">Sir C. Bunbury</a> to his next door
                    neighbours at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#CarltonHouse" title="Carlton House">Carlton House</a>;
                    carrying with me a large coppy of the poem. It was the intention of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyCharles" title="Sir C">Sir C</a> to have introduced me to the
                    Prince of Wales; but we were desired to call again in an hour; we did so; but
                    one of the brothers (I think) Prince Adolphus was with him; and afterwards Mr
                    Tierney; so that, not being likely to be disengaged; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyCharles" title="Sir C">Sir C</a> proposed to leave the Book,
                    which was done; and promised if the Prince should wish to see me, he (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyCharles" title="Sir C">Sir C</a>) would let me know,
                    &amp;c. I received Ten Guineas from the hand of my most zealous friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyCharles" title="Sir C">Sir C</a>, which, with a handsome
                    complimentary letter, came to his house for me, from H.R.H. the Duke of York.
                    the letter I have now enclosed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft">Mr.
                        Lofft</a>; it will come back to your hand; send it to me again soon; don't
                    deface it, &amp;c. With regard to the copyright of the Farmer's Boy; I
                    believe <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a> did not
                    understand it; it was not Messrs. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VernorThomas" title="Vernor">Vernor</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Hood">Hood</a> offer'd to
                    buy it, it was another bookseller hinted about purchasing it of me and them, but
                    the measure was overruled, and I am glad of it, as you will see by the enclosed
                    letter of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Loffts">Mr. Loffts</a>. Send the
                    enclosed to Mrs Phillips. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="D of Grafton">D
                        of Grafton</a> desird me by letter to wait on him on Wednesday night, to
                    tell him 'what was doing to the second edition.' A Mr. Anesley and Mr. Harison
                    member for Thetford, were present, and each ordered 2 coppies; they were
                    deliverd next day.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I supd with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> on
                    Tuesday; he treated me with a sight of the Exhibition of paintings at Summersett
                    House, in company with his wife and son on Wednesday afternoon; he has likewise
                    promisd to settle with me for the first Edition next week. He gave me the
                    'Pleasures of Hope' and three handsome vols of 'Peter Pindar's works' (plenty of
                        laughter).<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> — I send 3 coppies of the poem, one
                    for you, (show it to all friends) and one for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamCousin" title="Mr W. Austin">Mr W. Austin</a>, and the other
                    for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MothersoleMrs" title="Mrs Mothersole">Mrs Mothersole</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GedgePeter" title="Mr Gedge">Mr Gedge</a> calld on me, and insisted on
                    giving me half a guinea. Nothing was said at the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Ds">Ds</a> about the Stamp

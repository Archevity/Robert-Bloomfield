<h4>Reusing and quoting from material from this website</h4>
	
	<h4 class="w3-text-grey">Fair Dealing</h4>
	<p>Fair dealing is legal exemption which allows the use of <em>short</em> quotations without permission from the copyright owner. It applies only to quotation used within works of criticism (eg. in academic work or critical journalism). Fair Dealing does not apply to any commercial use such as slogans, advertising or commercial publication, nor does it apply to reuse of prose or text for epigrams in books, or in publications for entertainment.</p>

<p>Fair dealing is not defined specifically by the law, but is tested in court. For general guidance you can cite up to 400 words in a single extract or 800 words split over several extracts. Note, however, that Fair Dealing does not allow for the reproduction of more than about twenty five per cent of a poem, however short a poem it is.</p>

<p>Publishers have varying definitions of Fair Dealing, so you are advised to ask your publisher if they require formal permission from the copyright owner.</p>

<p>This project is keen to encourage the use of our material, so please get in touch if you think your plans fall outside the Fair Dealing provisions.</p>

   <p style="text-align:center;">========</p>   
   
  <h4 class="w3-text-grey">What if I want to use longer quotations or a whole poem? Or what if I want to use a quotation from this material in a commercial or non-critical context, e.g. on a t-shirt, mug, on a website of favourite poems, etc.</h4>
   <p>We are delighted that you would like to reuse this material but please do not do so without first contacting us and obtaining necessary permissions. tfulford@dmu.ac.uk</p>
   
      <p style="text-align:center;">========</p>   
	 <h4 class="w3-text-grey">Sometimes it is easier just to link to the original source.</h4>
	  <p>If you want to reproduce a significant amount of text online, sometime it is simplest, and gives greatest intellectual transparency, to use a hyperlink that will guide your readers to the text in its original context, rather than copying it out on your own site. This helps readers avoid confusion about who the authors and copyright owners are.</p>

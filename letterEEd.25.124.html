'B.C.' to Robert Bloomfield, 28 April 1804<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">April 28 1804</p><p class="pnonident">Sir,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have been much gratified by a perusal of many of your poems,
                    the greater part of which I consider rank amongst the first of our English
                    productions, the whole of them certainly highly pleasing and entertaining. For
                    the amusement and instruction which I have received do me the favour to accept
                    the enclosed in return for which you will make an effort on the following
                    subject by way of Elegy.—A captain in the Royal Navy, lately return'd from a
                    foreign station on which he had been absent two or three years has lately
                    died—has not been home more than 3 or 4 months—was very successfull at sea, made
                    considerable prize money—had purchased a House in the Country where he expected
                    that delightfully domestic situation from the toils &amp; fatigues and
                    dangers to which he had been so recently exposed, and to which a country life is
                    so peculiarly favourable—was a Bachelor, but has left behind him a Brother and
                    two Sisters to whom he was peculiarly attachd to lament his loss as well as some
                    other more distant relations.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> He was a man of great fame in his profession, and in private life
                    yielded to none in those virtues which constitute the ornament and charm of
                    society. Generosity was perhaps his most striking feature.—I have made several
                    attempts at poetry, all of which <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I</em> consider very
                    unsuccessful, but some of my friends think otherwise and have particularly
                    pressed me from some private reasons which I cannot explain, to lament in poetry
                    the death of the person I have described.—If it were a common occasion I should
                    certainly attempt it myself, but as it is not so, and it is of some consequence
                    to me to excell in it, I must get you to attempt it for me, and to promise me at
                    the same time that your being its author shall ever remain a most profound and
                    entire secret—I know you to be a man of Honour and the advantages which I might
                    soon derive will certainly enable me to make you a much more liberal
                    compensation than that which I at present make for the delight afforded me by
                    your happy efforts. Let me have an answer by return of Post to acknowledge
                    Receipt of the enclosed &amp; to say if you will comply with my wishes.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am very much yours</p><p align="right">B.C. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> To be left, Post-office, Portsmouth, Hants</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The other half of the Note shall be sent on hearing that you

                        Bloomfield</a>, 14 September 1809<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Thursday Noon, Sept 14. 1809</p><p class="pnonident">My Dear Girl</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Your bundle of letters and the egg came safe of Tuesday night and
                    was most particularly wellcome, I enjoyd the evening exceedingly and thank'd
                    you. Remember that the road leading down from the Heath field towards <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Sapiston" title="Sapiston">Sapiston</a> was my favorite boyish walk and
                    makes a conspicuous figure in the Farmer's Boy. You had a grove with long green
                    walks or ridings on your left, and there <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">was</em> a grove on
                    your right, I suppose now down.—It was there I heard the morning song of the
                    birds and have often seen the Rabbit, the Pheasant, and all the tennants of the
                    woods in there glory, and I was in mine. You mentioned in your first that you
                    walkd with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverJohn" title="Mr Glover">Mr Glover</a> the Heath and
                    returnd down to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Sapiston" title="Sapiston">Sapiston</a>, having the
                    park— passing on your right. I think you must then have past over the upper part
                    of Mr Farrers Back—, as it reaches from nearly the back of his house to that
                    lane which has on the right hand as you return'd, what is calld park-grove.—I
                    really doubt whether your Swans have not deciev'd you. I never saw Swans in that
                    Brook in my life, and cannot imagine to whom they could belong. I think they
                    were Geese and you will say that I suppose you a Goose for not knowing the
                    difference, but I would rather hear that you make all the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Suffolk Geese Swans</em> than that you find them all dab-chicks. We learn
                    from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft's">Mr Lofft's</a> note that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftSarah" title="Mrs L">Mrs L</a>, and Nancy are returnd, and I
                    therefore hope that you will go there perhaps before you write again. I think
                    you would like to see old Thetford, and hope you will make a point of going up
                    the 'Danish mounds of partial green'.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> I wish
                    particularly that you would let us have a letter every Friday in future, and I
                    shall look out for it accordingly. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="Your Uncle George">Your Uncle George</a> in a note with the parcel said that 'the woman of
                    the house where she resides is a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rum one</em>, loves the Bottle,
                    and is afflicted with the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">meagrims</em>.' So you must be on your
                    guard and not mind every trifle that occurs. I suppose young George will be home
                    to London by the time you get this. Dont you really believe that Fakenham Wood
                    is larger than ours at Hornsey? I wish Jonas may please himself with a tune to
                    my Song, and that you may be able to sing it at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Troston" title="Troston">Troston</a>. When does <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> Fair begin? try to inform us
                    in your next. Our Chickens grow surprizingly and I have made a revolution as to
                    their appartments which has render'd them dry and handier to feed, I have taken
                    away the whole of the large Coop and both the small ones, and built them one
                    over the other on each side of the wash-house door, and cover'd with laths the
                    duck-yard from end to end for the Hens, so they have more room as well as being
                    shelterd. The whole appears now something in this way. [Drawing of hen house on
                    the page with text of the letter incorporated around it]</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Do if possible learn what is expected for the Dish and pay for
                    it. The picture I should like home if they seem willing to part with it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteAunt" title="Your Aunt Charlotte">Your Aunt Charlotte</a> and
                    Nurse, and Cousin Betsy
                    had tea with us on Tuesday, they are all well. Old Robbin Nair was calld 'old
                    Robbin' at least thirty years ago. He was once a Soldier and served in the West
                    Indies. If John Nash is living he is a very civil old man, and was one of the
                    harvest-men when I was a boy, you would like to talk with him, and <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">he</em> would like it. Dont you now see the great pleasure and
                    advantage of being able to draw, (I don't mean you to look at my specimen) for
                    if you could as expiditiously as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mrs Baker">Mrs
                        Baker</a> pop all the Barns and Stables in your pocket what a prize it
                    would be to last during the winter evenings! I wish you to give us a hint as to
                    what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacNephew" title="young Isaac">young Isaac</a> is about,
                    and where he is.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> And now for more home news. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary">Mary</a> of course cannot
                    write untill I send a parcell which I will do next time in reply to yours which
                    I expect on tomorrow week. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="Robert">Robert</a> talks without ceasing. I have got a load of good manure into
                    the Garden, perhaps Mr G will wonder at the price which is Twelve Shillings.
                    Mary Binley when she heard that we had a parcell, and that you had not written
                    to her replied 'you mind and tell your Father to blow her up'. I am sorry to say
                    that he is not at all cured, he roil'd me last night, that I was very hard set
                    to keep quiet with him, Another dream! and a kind of percevering hopes that I
                    know not what to do with. I know your present determination, and whenever you
                    return I will stick by you like a Leech, but I think it probable that before
                    that time I shall have a talk with him which will be very unsavory to us both.
                    For myself I have had some horrid nights, and am this morning very indifferent
                    indeed. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="Your Mother">Your Mother</a> is
                    midling, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter" title="Mary">Mary</a> is
                    chearful and willing. Tomorrow is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles's">Charles's</a> birthday and they all think of you by turns. If you would
                    like a bit of domestic information, a picture of matrimony, I have to inform you
                    that our Neighbour behind the wainscot has discovered that his wife has been
                    noodling him, and running him in debt, and the consequence is, that she is out
                    of his house, and he has advertized that he will pay no debts that she may
                    contract. I have room left to wish you every blessing that belongs to affection
                    and truth, and Am</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Once more your Affectionate Father</p><p align="right">Rob Bloomfield </p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add. MS 28268, ff.

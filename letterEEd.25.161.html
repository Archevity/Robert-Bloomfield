Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="Mary Ann Bloomfield">Mary Ann Bloomfield</a>, 28–29 May 1805<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">City Road. Tuesday Afternoon </p><p align="right">May 28<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1805 </p><p class="pnonident">My Dear Mary</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> What I am going to write I know will only perplex you, and yet I must of course tell you. You wishd to learn <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Mr Young's">Mr Young's</a> opinion as to healing the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Child's">Child's</a> knee. I find by a note this morning that he strongly advises not, as follows</p><p class="pnonident">—'I was aware that at Worthing <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> would be advised to heal the knee and I
                    doubt not many will recommend him to apply the seaweed poultice, but I most strongly recommend you not to think of healing the
                    part at present—He has been but a very little time at Worthing, and as yet no judgement can be form'd of the influence so
                    favourable a change of air is calculated to produce, by either his appearance or the state of the knee.—Let us therefore wait
                    patiently under the present local treatment attending to his general health, and with regard to any future alteration in the plan,
                    we will occasionally communicate. Remember me to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn" title="Mrs Bloomfield">Mrs Bloomfield</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> and little <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a>.'—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Now upon this new trouble what can be said. You see that when two men are in direct opposition that <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">both</em> cannot be obeyd. You will have received my parcel and a letter saying that I wishd you to heat the knee if you
                    thought proper, but if you have not commenc'd it, you have yet a choice of continuing <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Mr Young's">Mr
                        Young's</a> method a fortnight or three weeks longer, if you can prevail on yourself to do it, and then in July to recur to
                    Mr Morah's treatment. But I doubt if the latter knows that you have advise from London he will not relish the job. and if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Mr Young">Mr Young</a> finds himself discarded after this fresh application to his judgement he will
                    not be pleas'd. I almost now advise to continue the discharge though my heart ache at the thought of your trouble and the Boy's
                    pain. You, must determine, as you know when you receive this whither you <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">have</em> said to Mr Morah that you mean
                    to heal it. If you have not, you might say that you wish to wait a little while and then to apply to him again when the summer
                    gets up. Or, if you have relax'd in the present treatment and put him under Mr Morah, then <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Mr Young's">Mr Young's</a> notion must be set aside for we cannot afford to pay two Doctors. And as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Mr Young">Mr Young</a> was behind in his information so that I could not send it by the parcel, he
                    cannot be surprised that you take a contrary course to his wish.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Of these things you must try to judge as you can, and though you wish to have <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Young">Young</a> have the utmost try at him, I shall not be sorry to hear that his knee is heald, at least for a while, so that
                    you must do that which you think best at the moment. consult with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a>, and try
                    to please yourselves. I will not blame you for your determination, but my advise is that you would (if you have not heald it) keep
                    it moderately open for some short time longer until I can talk to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#YoungThomas" title="Young">Young</a>, and hear from
                    you again.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I know that I contradict myself in what I have written, for my mind is much agitated, but surely there can be no
                    harm in keeping it open a week or fortnight longer till we can hear more. You no doubt was in hopes of having the two Doctors
                    concur in their opinions, but don't you know the old saying that 'Doctors will differ.' I am sure I can be happy which ever way
                    you do. God bless you all, and direct you for the best.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Yours very poorly</p><p align="right">Robert Bloomfield</p><p class="pnonident"><span xmlns="" id="index.xml-label-NAA01DF"><!--anchor--></span>P.S.

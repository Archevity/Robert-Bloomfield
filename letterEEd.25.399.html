                    but little of the corespondence of my departed 'brother bard' what I do posses
                    you are welcome too &amp; as to my letters to him you may do with them just
                    as you please &amp; make what use of them you like</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I deeply regret that ill health prevented our corespondence
                    &amp; that death prevented us from being better acquainted I sincerely loved
                    the man &amp; admired his Genius &amp; had a strong anxiety to make a
                    journey to spend a day with him on my second visit to London &amp; I
                    intended to have stopt at Biggleswade on my return home for that purpose but my
                    purse got too near the bottom for a stoppage on the road &amp; as it was too
                    great a distance to walk home this with other matters prevented me from seeing
                    him as one of my family was very ill at the same time &amp; hastened my
                    return—Whatever cause his friends may have to regret the death of the Poet—Fame
                    is not one [of] them for he dyed ripe for immortality &amp; had he written
                    nothing else but 'Richard &amp; Kate' <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> that fine picture of Rural Life were sufficient to establish his name as the English Theocritus &amp;
                    the first of rural Bards in this country &amp; as Fashion (that feeble
                    substitute for Fame) had nothing to do in his exaltation its neglect will have
                    nothing to affect his memory it is built on a more solid foundation &amp;
                    time will bring its own reward to the 'Farmers Boy'—I beg you will have the
                    kindness to take <em>care of the M.S. &amp; return it</em> when
                    you have done with it as I wish to preserve a scrap of his handwriting—the Copy
                    on the other side is a note which accompanied his present of 'Mayday with the
                    Muses' I gave the origional to Allan Cunningham the Poet <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a>
                    who has a high respect for Bloomfields genius &amp; whose request on that
                    account to posses a scrap of his writing) I was proud &amp; happy to
                    gratifye—soon after the Poets death I wrote in a mellancholy feeling 3 Sonnets
                    to his memory.</p>

                    this Spring: with my best wishes that your kindly labours for the memory of the

                                April, to make some alterations. Clare noted in his journal for 30

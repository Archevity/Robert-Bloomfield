Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac Bloomfield">Isaac Bloomfield</a>, 29 April 1811<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">City Road. Monday. April 29. 1811</p><p class="pnonident">Dear Brother</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> By the time I could get inteligence of the kind required from
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BoysJohn" title="Mr Boys">Mr Boys</a>, I found it too far in the
                    last week to get it to your hand by Saturday's Waggon. I therefore write by the
                    first post in this week, and wish I had better news to send. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BoysJohn" title="Mr B.">Mr B.</a> calld here two days after I had
                    yours and began with 'So I find <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="your Brother">your Brother</a> is gone home! I calld as I came along at your Brother's
                    in Moorfields where I first heard of it' &amp;c. I then felt anxious to
                    explain to him by confab the why and the wherefore, but he was not alone, and
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldJames" title="James">James</a>, who then lodged here
                    while <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="the sick boy">the sick boy</a> came
                    back, was just come in. The next morning I sent him your letter in the following
                    envelope which I copied that you might see what I said.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> 'I enclose <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="my Brother's">my
                        Brother's</a> letter that you may <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">read</em> him for
                    yourself. He has work'd indefatigably at his job<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> while here, but
                    found that he could not perform the labour so fast as he expected. In
                    consideration of circumstances which, I understand he made you acquainted with,
                    namely being oblidge'd to send part of your bounty to the family, he ran short,
                    and determin'd to take a conditional walk home, and give a Spring dressing to
                    his Garden. He can have no claim on your further assistance certainly, and he
                    feels delicately situated, and still confident of success without the means. And
                    to me this information which has thus fallen to my lot to give is at least as
                    delicate, for <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">you</em> know that I ought not, and <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He</em> knows that I dare not offer to stand Godfather to your
                    money. I leave you therefore entirely to yourselves, with admiration of your
                    generosity, and love for your character. And Am &amp;c.'</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Another two days elapse'd when he calld here with a large party
                    of Girls and brought tea and Sugar in his pocket &amp;c and now I found him
                    asking for further information and repeating that 'he did not understand it.' He
                    referd me to my own writing (as above) where I mention'd your having sent money
                    to your family, and appeard, I say <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">appeard</em> totally ignorant
                    of such application of any more than that you had stated to him in writing
                    relative to a G. piece some time before. He was anxious to see the process and I
                    felt that I could not do otherwise than draw forth my key. He seemd to wonder at
                    the scale on which you had proceeded, and (I thought) lookd displeased and
                    dissappointed, talkd repeatedly of his perswasion of its failure from <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">what he had heard</em>, and said that it was you who had made a
                    wrong estimate, for you had stated to him the Sum of –––– would enable you, you
                    thought, to bring you to a certainty. 'And that I let him have that he might
                    perfect it, or undecieve himself and set his heart at ease.' I thought it not my
                    place to hint to him the conditional promise which he made to you of a further
                    loan, and it was to that I had alluded in my note above that you had '<em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">no claim</em> &amp;c' On the whole I am sure is he sick of
                    the job, but that need not prevent your explaining by writing to him any thing
                    you may feel to be requisite and just, or correcting any thing which I may have
                    misrepresented or of <del>any</del> still keeping the thing
                    alive by the best means in your power, He owns that he knows no more of
                    Mechanism than I do, but he knows I suppose a great deal more about the
                    Guineas.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldJames" title="James">James</a> was here yesterday

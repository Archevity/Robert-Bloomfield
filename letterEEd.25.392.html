		<p class="pnonident">My Dear Charles,</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> You are aware, from my former letters, that Messrs. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Baldwin">Baldwin</a> and Co. were so kind as to
                    advance a bill for one hundred pounds at twelve months, to enable us to come to
                    some settlement with our creditors, and that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a> induced them to accept a
                    composition of seven shillings in the pound,* and promising to divide amongst
                    them the proceeds from the sale of the cottage at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honington">Honington</a>, though the delay which had
                    hitherto existed made this a forlorn hope. This arrangement relieved us from
                    some anxiety for our personal safety; and we sold our little property (books and
                    furniture), to enable us to come to London to seek our living. Still, we did not
                    consider ourselves out of <em>debt</em>; and the settlement for the
                    cottage being still delayed, we left <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a> with a determination to pay them whenever it might be in our
                    power, and a <em>hope</em> that it might be <em>soon</em>. This you <em>already</em> know; and I have now the   pleasure of informing you, that we have obtained seventy pounds for the cottage, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a> sent it to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a> yesterday, making up the whole
                    amount from the produce of our sale; so that we are now completely free from   debt, and have somewhere about forty pounds to divide amongst five of us for two   years. But who of our family does not agree with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a>, that the unspotted   character which our dear father maintained should remain unblemished by his
                    family? which could not have been, had we suffered his creditors to lose any    part of their debts while it was <em>possible</em> for us to pay   them. Let me hear from you soon.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Your affectionate sister,</p><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah Bloomfield">Hannah Bloomfield</a></p><p class="pnonident"><span xmlns="" id="index.xml-label-N19101C1"><!--anchor--></span>P. S. Our friends, or rather the friends of our father, have    instituted a subscription for our benefit, which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr. Weston">Mr. Weston</a> thinks has commenced
                        auspiciously; but you must be aware that it is a very <em>uncertain resource</em>; but be its produce what it may, I hope, with                        the aid of our own exertions, we shall make it do.</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> * <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="The Editor">The Editor</a> of     this work, having been generally blamed, (as a friend of the family) for not   advising them to remove their little property to London for sale, begs leave
                        to assign the following reasons for the advice which he gave:–</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> 1st, The inconsiderable value of the property, which,
                        according to the best estimates, did not exceed seventy pounds, including
                        everything.</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> 2nd, The difficulty of proving in London that the articles
                        were genuine, i.e. that they were actually the property of the deceased.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> 3rd, The general <em>uncertainty</em> of sales in
                        London, and the <em>certain</em> expense of conveyance thither. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> 4th, The propriety of convincing the creditors (who had
                        agreed, conditionally, to take a moderate composition) that the whole
                        property was really offered for sale.</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> 5th, To afford the creditors themselves an opportunity of
                        preventing any article from being sold for less than its value.</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> 6th, The inconvenience it would have been to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="the Editor">the Editor</a> to superintend the
                        sale in London; and at the same time arrange the writings of the deceased,
                        and settle his affairs in the country.</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> 7th, His reliance on public sympathy and benevolence to
                        supply for the family the imperfections of his own arrangements.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a></p></div>

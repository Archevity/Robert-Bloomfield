		<p>Dear Sir</p>
		<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Two letters I have received one of which was principally an account of what is going forward with all the pomp of military preparation at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Woolwich" title="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, with your reasons for retiring thither for some days. I hope this retirement has answered for your
                    health. And by your second letter it seems in a good degree to have done so.
                    That 2d was in part an intimation of some poetical compositions of yours which
                    were to come down by Mrs. Philips. These have not yet reacht me.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Your brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="Mr Go. Bloomfields">Mr Go.
                        Bloomfields</a> sonnet on the birth of my daughter is much admird.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> There ought, however, to have
                    been no stop after 'fear.' And in the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BuryStEdmunds" title="Bury">Bury</a> paper 'To thee' has been strangely printed instead of 'For
                    thee.'</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Your third letter I ought now more particularly to notice. Many
                    of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DrakeNathan" title="Dr Drake's">Dr Drake's</a> objections to
                    particular lines (indeed most of them, I believe) had occurred to me in reading
                    the poem. And most of his proposed amendments satisfy me very well. I must
                    object notwithstanding to his saying that Heaven cannot be a dissyllable. It
                    closes a couplet and rhimes to a complete dissyllable in one of the most finishd
                    productions of one of our most correct poets in the mechanism of versification. </p><div xmlns="" class="lg"><div <p style="text-indent:120px;"> Yet simple Nature to his hope has given,</div>

					<p class="indent8"> Ess: on Man. I <a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a></p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> And I think <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mrs Lofft">Mrs Lofft</a>
                    has been very right in doing the same in one of her sonnets.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> As to the title, I dislike The Vaccine Rose. I think there is more of a trifling allusion in it than of any thing beside. And that founded on a very slight affinity.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> And I would make the title simply </p>
					<p align="center">Vaccine Inoculation</p><p align="center">a Poem</p>
					<p align="center">By Robert Bloomfield</p>
					<p class="pnonident">without adding author of—— For who knows not now that you are author of the
                    Farmer's Boy and of the Rural Tales.<a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Generally I can not see the objection to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DrakeNathan" title="Dr Drake's">Dr Drake's</a> Essay being prefixt. Two paragraphs in it I do, however, most earnestly hope that he will omit. They
                    appear to me quite incompatible with liberty civil &amp; religious: And with
                    good policy as to this very object. These are those in which he recommends that
                    inoculation for the small pox be prohibited by authority. And that every
                    Minister be enjoin'd to recommend to his parishioners vaccine inoculation as a
                    moral &amp; religious duty.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Now as to the first Inoculation for the small pox is almost
                    always a great mitigator of the evils of that disease. And frequently it reduces
                    them as it did in the case of three out of four of my children who were thus
                    inoculated to work to no evil or inconvenience. And the one who had it most had
                    it with what would have been called great mildness for the natural small pox;
                    though with comparative severity for the inoculated. Now where a practice so
                    greatly reduces Danger and Mischief to the individuals who use it, I do not see
                    the right which Government &amp; Legislature have to prohibit this practice
                    entirely and to force persons to run the risque of the natural small pox for
                    themselves &amp; their children or to submit to a new mode of inoculation
                    which to them may be much less agreeable &amp; satisfactory. And against
                    which if they have any prejudices, those prejudices may be very greatly
                    encreased by having all choice between the two modes of inoculation taken away
                    from them. For a century medical reasoning &amp; general benevolence have
                    been exerted to conquer the repugnance to inoculation for the smallpox. And now
                    that repugnance is very nearly annihilated how strange it would be to say we
                    forbid you under severe legal restrictions from using this precaution which has
                    been so long, so diffusively, so earnestly and so effectually recommended. What
                    should we think of a law to compel the use of Bark or of James's Powder
                    unspeakably beneficial as both those medicines have been!<a href="#4"> [4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> Men
                    will find out at last what is best in what most concerns them: but they neither
                    will nor ought to be forced into it. All that seems necessary or allowable in
                    this instance is to regulate the places where persons shall be received for
                    inoculation and to publish such rules for the conduct of persons under it as
                    shall make them least likely to endanger themselves or to communicate the
                    infection.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Then as to the other step. Is it impossible for any minister who
                    may be a prudent &amp; good man to doubt whither vaccine inoculation be a
                    moral &amp; religious duty. If it is impossible a duty so clear may be
                    surely trusted to its own clearness &amp; the general comprehension. But if
                    a man may doubt it, think how great a force upon reason and conscience to
                    compell him to enjoin on his parishioners what he disbelieves. How it degrades
                    his character &amp; office as a minister of truth &amp; freedom!</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> No; if vaccine inoculation be right Reason &amp; Experience are sufficient to establish it. Of any thing worth having, compulsion is a most
                    unsuitable instrument for conveying it to mankind.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I had much my doubts on vaccine inoculation. These doubts in a
                    great measure give way. And its not being infectious is assuredly an important consideration. I incline to think we shall have our little Sarah inoculated with the matter which communicates the vaccine inflammation. But if such Prohibitions &amp; Injunctions were imposd they might perhaps cause me not to inoculate her at all.</p>
				<p style="text-indent:40px;"> With the omission of this part I should think the Essay might be
                    properly and usefully prefixt to the poem.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> My objections to the latter part of the poem are not so much on
                    the ground of incorrectness as of thinking that it is not in general equal in originality and animation &amp; pathetic effect to the beginning.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I know not that I am quite satisfied with the expression the cause is up. I cannot think it very elegant poetical or correct. I cannot change I believe my opinion that the embellishment of the peal of thunder at the
                    funeral should be wholly rejected. And without it this is a natural &amp; awfully affecting passage.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I rather incline to publication. But hope if the Essay is publisht with the poem as I think it should, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DrakeNathan" title="Dr Drake">Dr Drake</a> will see the force of these bjections.... </p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am, yours sincerely,</p>

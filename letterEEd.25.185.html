Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Isaac Bloomfield">Isaac Bloomfield</a>, undated <a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p class="pnonident">I tried hard to get a letter to you on Saturday last, but was unable to do it
                    through having several others to write, and much to attend to. Yours came safe,
                    and I think the letter will do you credit wherever it may be seen. I have
                    written to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Hampstead" title="Hampstead">Hampstead</a> to say that I
                    have such a letter to shew them, &amp;c.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> You are right in your observations as to the importance of the
                    first step, indeed so much depend on that, that I have the M.S. by me now, and
                    hardly know what best to do with it. I could certainly have access to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrotchWilliam" title="Dr Crotch">Dr Crotch</a>, though I do not know him
                    personally; or to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ShieldWilliam" title="Mr Shield">Mr Shield</a>, but
                    the latter promises more than he performs. I think the best way would be to ask
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">some</em> one of them to mark with a pencil what offends
                    their ear, and is wrong? And then to let you correct it yourself.—If you
                    received it back as it is, and should show it to Mr Mills, perhaps he is not
                    competent to judge of its merit, though he may be of his disposition to promote
                    the publication if found worthy.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> In answer to your queries, I think there is no doubt but I could
                    get some one to point out the incorrections for your emendation, and as to its
                    being published by subscription I will get all the names in my power, and
                    allways intended to do so. I have but little guess as to how many names I could
                    get, but I think surely 40, or sufficient to cover the expences, but I do not
                    see that any progress can be made until the anthems are ready to go to the music
                    engravers. I have a great fancy to learn if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrotchWilliam" title="Dr Crotch">Dr Crotch</a> is in Town, for he in his
                    letters to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharp">Miss Sharp</a> has
                    expresst a great desire to be acquainted, and is, I should suppose, well
                    qualified to judge.—He was one of those infant prodigies in the musical way
                    which sometimes arise to make the world stare. When a child of 4 years old, in
                    petticoats, he play'd the organ, and the most masterly pieces too before the
                    King and all the toppers in the country. He was a wonderful and pleasing
                    exhibition in his childhood, and is now professor of music at Oxford. At all
                    events, whoever has the M.S. from me, you may rely on that I have the success of
                    the job too much at heart to let it lie long or to neglect to give you
                    information.—So that on the whole I mean to make some of them point out the
                    errors, and immediately to write to you, or send the Book if necessary. I have a
                    neighbour, an American who is a most extraordinary mechanic and musician, I mean
                    to just shew him the anthems and hear him play them. He has a patent for an
                    improved pianoforte or rather for one on a new construction, and he is now
                    nearly perfecting an instrument which by keys play all the notes from the lowest
                    on the Bass viol up to the treble of the Violin, on perpendicular catgut strings
                    68 in number which are placed just inside the verges of 4 hoops which lie
                    horizontally, and have a uniform motion (by a treadle) the inner sides of which
                    are lined with horsehair (a fiddlestick) so that the Bow being a fixture, the
                    string wanted to express any note is drawn by the finger key into contact with
                    the circular Bow. But this I fear you will not understand unless you could see
                    it. The effect is grand and peculiarly impressive.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> My time is expired</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Love to all.—</p><p align="right">Yours Robert</p><p class="pnonident">Your hapiness at the Christmas gives us great pleasure to reflect on</p><p class="l"><em>Address: </em><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother" title="Mr Isaac Bloomfield">Mr Isaac Bloomfield</a> / <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Honington" title="Honnington">Honnington</a>.<br xmlns=""/></p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add.

Messrs <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VernorThomas" title="Vernor">Vernor</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Hood">Hood</a> to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Capel Lofft">Capel Lofft</a>, copy of a letter not
                    sent, with annotations in Bloomfield's hand, 26 November
                        1800<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p class="pnonident">Sir</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> It is an old saying and a true one that wonders will never cease.
                    This reflection is occasioned by seeing your letter to Mr Bloomfield wherein you
                    assert that no right or title in the Farmers Boy belongs to us. — We could
                    hardly think that you was serious in this after all that has pass'd Between you,
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillThomas" title="Mr Hill">Mr Hill</a>, and us. But we percieve
                    that you are not given to joke, and therefore we shall think that you mean to
                    consider it seriously as you say. In this situation we are very sorry to say
                    that the Harvest that promised the Author will be blasted by a contest which
                    neither he, any of his friends here, nor us expected. We have no fear of the
                    issue of the contest if it is your determination to persist in it as our proofs
                    are ready to come forward whenever you are pleased to bring it forward. But we
                    are sorry to say that whatever be the issue of it the poor Author will
                    ultimately suffer as wel as us, by the stop that will take place in the sale —
                    for we only wait your determination to guide our conduct. Thus far we assert our
                    property — but, as fair liberal Tradesmen (a character we never have forfeited)
                    we shall reason the matter with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr
                        Lofft</a>.——In the first place then is it at all probable that we, or any
                    Bookseller (or <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gentleman</em> we will add) would undertake to
                    print a poem, (which had been handed about to 4 booksellers and offer'd for
                    nothing) &amp; whose merits were not known, (and to this day contested pro
                    &amp; con by the literary world), at the enormous expence of £190 without we
                    had some <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">interest</em> in it — that we should print it at our
                    own risque, stand the chance of loss, and engage to give the Author 20 guineas
                    [i] whither it succeeded or not, Or that we should put another Edition to press
                    before half the first was sold off (259 Quartos are <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">still</em>
                    in hand) It is not very probable that a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">selfish</em> Bookseller
                    should do this, (which no Gentleman of fortune would have done) when he can
                    every day lay out his money to a good advantage, without risque at all, perhaps
                    not inferior to what we shall get by the Farmer's Boy. — Thus far it is not
                    reasonable to suppose — Another consideration for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> is — that the benefit does
                    not arise to the Author from the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">merit</em> of the poem merely,
                    but as much so from the merits of the Booksellers, <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">in bringing
                        it forward with every advantage in its favour, of ornaments and printing, of
                        his pushing over England, Scotland, Ireland &amp; America at his own
                        risque and expense and influence</em>. His selling a large quantity to
                    Ireland at a reduced price (considerably under what he shall account for) in
                    order to prevent it from being printed there, and running away with the market.
                    Of his being oblidged to give credit to the trade to the amount of 11–12ths of
                    the whole (for we have not received above 1/12 in cash for all the Editions)
                    and, of course have several Bankrupts accounts in the Book [ii] — That we should
                    be at this moment £550 out of pocket for a work in which we have no right,
                    (except the first Edition as you say) and only a commission on what we sell,
                    when we could lay out that money with the advantage of 25 or 50 pr cent in our
                    own business — These are ideas that no man acquainted with business would say
                    were any way probable — It is also necessary to inform <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> that the <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">universal custom of trade</em> is against him. No Bookseller what ever
                    prints another mans property &amp; pays for it <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">himself</em>
                    upon the meer profits of commission, <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">the Author pays for
                        it,</em> the Bookseller sells, and pays for what he sells at the end of the
                    year, deducting 10 P Cent for selling. If this does not refer to the first
                    Edition (suposing the copyright out of the case) it must refer to the other
                    agreeable to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a>'s ideas — We
                    therefore should not have been presumed to print a second, third and fourth
                    Edition unless we had not been assured that one half of the copyright of the
                    Farmer's Boy was ours, &amp; no one could expect us to do it.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> We think it necessary to notice what you say respecting the offer
                    that we made on behalf of another Bookseller (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomasN" title="Longmans">Longmans</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ReesOwen" title="Rees">Rees</a>) we wrote you that a Bookseller
                    would give £100 for <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mr Bloomfields copy-right</em> in the
                    Farmer's Boy after the second Edition; but you cannot surely from that wrest out
                    a meaning that we considerd the<em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> whole</em> copyright as his,
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomasN" title="Longmans">Longmans</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ReesOwen" title="Rees">Rees</a> will set you right in this respect
                    by informing you of the matter of our conversation — And I have to say that I
                    thought their offer not unworthy of mentioning to you, and I promised them as
                    much as to mention it, although I told them I would not advise it to be sold. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Now Sir we will be free to say that after what has been done by
                    us — After giving the Author £100 — which he could not expect or demand, we
                    think ourselves <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">most unhandsomely used</em> by his friends; for
                    we find that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SwanJames" title="Mr Swan">Mr Swan</a> has been rather
                    medling, more than his <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">literary knowledge</em> gave us reason to
                    expect for however honest a man he may be, we are confident his knowledge of
                    literary bargains cannot entitle his opinion to much consideration. Other
                    friends of the Author were perfectly satisfied with what we had done, we were
                    satisfied in our own minds that we had done only what was right, and the Author
                    was so far satisfied [iii] of it, that he said it was beyond what he had any
                    right to expect, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SwanJames" title="Mr Swan">Mr Swan</a> was
                    present upon the occasion. — Now Sir, <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">we will maintain our
                        right</em> as agreed to by the Author, and in the meantime till this is
                    settled, we shall hold ourselves bound to act with the Book as heretofore <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">as one half of our property</em>, and sell accordingly, as we
                    are unwilling that a worthy man should suffer from an Idle despute Between us. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The receipt or assignment which we gave Mr B to copy <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">is a meer matter of form</em> used by Booksellers in conveying
                    copyright from one to another. We can assure <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> that were the copyright <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a thousand times</em> more valuable than it is we should not be
                    guilty of such a piece of <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Villainy</em> as he is afraid of and
                    if he will take the trouble to enquire we think that he will find that we have
                    done more than we were oblidged to perform in our engagements with Authors, and
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">never</em> less — One thing we are determined to do in
                    future, and that is, that we shall have no concern with any Author's work <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">that is not our own property</em>. For we find that if we were
                    to give <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">all</em> there is still some cause for dissatisfaction. </p><p class="indent2"> We are Sir </p><p class="indent2"> Your Obed Servants</p><p class="indent7"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VernorThomas" title="Vernor">Vernor</a>

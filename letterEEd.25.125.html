Robert Bloomfield to 'B.C.', 28 April 1804<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">London April 28th 1804—.</p><p class="pnonident">Sir</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> It is a matter of the utmost astonishment to me that any man
                    could for a moment trust his reputation in the keeping of a stranger in the
                    manner you propose to do with me!</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Granting that you may be right when you call me <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a
                        man of honour</em>, you probably mean that I would keep the secret if I
                    bound myself to do it. But to what man of honour would a sensible stranger offer
                    the wages of prostitution! Perhaps Sir, you may have written thus merely to try
                    how far I might be tempted by the prospect of gain to forfeit all pretence to
                    independance, and to put myself compleatly in the power of an anonymous enemy,
                    for friendship there can be none in the endeavour to seduce any man from the
                    paths of truth and principle, whatever may be said in approval of his actions
                    and excellences, or whatever flattery may be offered to his vanity. I deem
                    myself entirely justified in this severity, if I am to consider the application
                    as <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">serious</em>. But if it is to pass as a joke it reminds me of
                    one much better which took place between Dean Swift and Mr Pope, when the former
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">offered the latter twenty pounds to change his
                        Religion!!</em> Whatever may be your views and expectations as to the
                    property of the worthy Officer you wish to praise in verse, I beg of you to
                    consider that the celebration of candour, truth, and sincerity in him, would be
                    an everlasting reproach on yourself who would appear to the world to have paid a
                    debt of justice to the dead, while your conscience would only have this poor
                    consolation, that by the bait of wealth you had made another man as great a
                    Rogue and fool as yourself. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I send back your half of the ten pound note, with feelings that I
                    am sure are very far from a unison with yours, but calculated perhaps to honour
                    either in verse or prose such virtues as you attribute to the Captain. they
                    stand more conspicuous from the striking contrast in which you have placed them
                    with yourself. If you had sent nothing in your letter but the request I would
                    not have troubled you nor myself with this reply to an unknown hand, but the
                    return of your note gives me opportunity to assure you that the offer of Mr. B.
                    C. is not accepted on the part of R. B. only as a novel and strange kind of
                    indignity, to which my situation renders me liable, but which I could wish to
                    prevent the repetition of if it was in my power.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Wishing you success in all <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">honest</em>

	<h3>302a. Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BrydgesSamuelEgerton" title="Samuel Egerton Brydges">Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges</a>, 12 June 1816<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3>
			
	<p align="right">Shefford. Bedd’s June 12 1816</p>
	<p>To Sir Egerton Brydges, Bart</p>
	<p>Sir</p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Perhaps I greatly presume when I thus address you by letter, but you are strictly and truly a litterary Character, and love poetry. This is quite enough for me to know at present, and the attentions you have formerly bestow’d upon me are at the same time not forgotten. <a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a></p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;"> My Suffolk friends after hearing of some of my misfortunes, and my very precarious health, have, for a third time, seemingly determined to assist me by some means or other, and the last and best determination is, to publish for my benefit a subscription Edition of <i>all that I have written</i>, in a splendid way, to bear the price of 2 Guineas! <a href="#2"> [2] </a><a name="back2"> </a>Publick notice of this undertaking will soon be given; but in the interem, and as a previous step, I am calld upon to sound my friends, for the purpose of giving my Booksellers, Messrs <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BaldwinRobert" title="Robert Baldwin">Baldwin</a> Craddock &amp; Joy, some idea of the probable success and extent of the undertaking. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;">With this short view of the subject Sir, and impertinent as it may appear, I venture to ask for your name, and <del>xxxx</del> the names of your friends who have a relish for hedge-row poetry, <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> and I want more particularly to hear if you approve of such a plan, and how many names you may be able to collect by the end of this month, &amp; when, if you will honour me with an answer, or send your reply through my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ParkThomas" title="Thomas Park">T. Park</a> Esq. of Hampstead, I shall feel greatly obliged, for I am far from well, as my writing too plainly shows. </p>
			<p style="text-indent:40px;">Persons and places will be appointed where money will be received—I have now no power to recieve any thing but names,—but of these, the more, and the more honourable, the greater will be the glory to those who have started the measure, and who claim me as their Countryman. . .</p>
<p>With Grt Respect I am Sir your most</p>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Humble serv<sup>t</sup>
<p style="text-indent:40px;">Rob<sup>t</sup> Bloomfield.</p>

<p>
In all likelihood names will be recieved untill September at least, but this &lt;present&gt; is a previous measure.—No more copies will be printed than are actually subscribed for.—I write now to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JennerEdward" title="Edward Jenner">Dr Jenner</a>, and other Gloucestershire friends—to the ‘Good<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Augustus Henry Grafton"> Fitzroy</a>’ family, and to all I can muster. Mr Park is in some degree apprised of the affair, and my neighbour Sir George Osborn, and Lady, <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="back4"> </a>are my sure friends.</p>
<p><del>xxxx</del></p>
<p>R.B.</p>
<p>
I have this fair opportunity of returning thanks for your prompt and kind reply to my Dover request when I wanted to see the Heights, and the Castle. I saw Mr Fector, and was not dissappointed in any thing but time. <a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="back5"> </a></p>

Brydges then launched a plain subscription for Bloomfield’s relief, with no luxury edition promised, and personally helped Bloomfield with money. See Letters 303, 304 and 305. After Bloomfield’s death, his daughter again appealed to Brydges for assistance, but he had by then left Britain to escape his creditors: see Letter 305. <a href="#back2">BACK</a></p>

				<p class="letnote2"><a name="3">3  </a>Angus Whitehead observes of this phrase that it appears to be Bloomfield’s self-deprecating coinage, though the <cite>OED</cite> defines ‘hedge-poet’ as a poet ‘born, brought up, habitually sleeping, sheltering or plying their trade under hedges, or by the road-side (and hence used generally as an attribute expressing contempt)’.

Bloomfield had hoped he might be introduced to the Tsar Alexander, one of the European monarchs who had arrived in Dover en route to the celebrations, in London, of the abdication of Napoleon. <a href="#back5">BACK</a></p>

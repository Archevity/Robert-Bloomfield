						of that extraordinary accumulation of the monuments of ancient arts which war and opulence had occasioned to be gathered
						together in France and Britain, at the expense of Italy, I took up my residence in the Adelphi, where I invited all those who
						might happen to favour my design kindly to resort and to favour me with their advice.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The Admirable <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarryJames" title="Barry">Barry</a>, ex-professor of painting in the Royal Academy,

						resorted to my abode on Sunday mornings, when I opened my doors, and when they honoured me with their confidence and
						advice.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Along with these interesting visitors I am proud to recollect the presence of many other men high in the first
						esteem of a discerning few, who are capable of shutting their eyes against the glare of popular delusion, and of seeing things
						as they are, or as they ought to be. '<em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dis cari ipsis</em>'<a href="#9"> [9]</a><a name="back9"> </a> The time was delightfully spent on such an errand and

						pieces, which he accompanied with a symphony of broken expression and with frequent tears. We were highly pleased, and invited
						him to return. He returned with the first copy of his book and recited other tales. We forwarded the sale of his book, of
						which he afterwards informed me that in the rapid editions that followed he sold five thousand copies.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I was, while in the Adelphi, to sit for my portrait to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GardinerWilliam" title="Rev.d William Gardiner">Rev.<sup xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> William Gardiner</a>, then become bookseller in union with Mr. Harding, engraver, &amp;c., in
						Pall Mall,<a href="#11"> [11]</a><a name="back11"> </a> and having made a sentimental visit to the birth-place of Newton, at Woolsthorp, I was to be represented
						venerating the spot and the orchard where that great man first conceived by the falling of an apple the theory of gravitation,
						in its application to the motions of the heavenly bodies. While I sate for my picture I happened to mention the sudden and
						extraordinary manner of my mother's death, accompanied with circumstances preceding it, which are of too sacred and too

						hastily written, of which the following is a copy, and which being, as he frankly says in it, a picture of his own mind, I
						have thought it a proper introduction to his 'Wild Flowers,' and recommend it accordingly to the readers of that little

Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah Bloomfield">Hannah
                        Bloomfield</a>, 4 July 1814<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right"><a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Shefford" title="Shefford">Shefford</a> July 4. 1814</p><p class="pnonident">Dear Hannah</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> In my letter of yesterday I left off rather abruptly, and in a
                    way which you was not likely to comprehend. I there said that the Herald was
                    follow'd by a Band, but to accommodate that Band a Boat was procured from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Chicksands" title="Chicksands">Chicksands</a>, placed upon a carriage,
                    and surmounted by boughs of Oak and Laurel, and in the front rode Judy
                    Basterfield in White, and crown'd with a wreath, as the emblem of <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peace</em>. In the procession rode <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilliamsonEdmund" title="Mr Williamson">Mr Williamson</a> &amp;c, Mr
                    Walker, (two church parsons,) Mr Potier, the Catholick priest, and Briggs the
                    Methodest preacher, and all who could procure Horses, or wish'd to join the
                    Cavalcade, In the rear of which appeard an old black Horse decorated with an
                    enormous pair of Bullock's horns place'd near his ears. On his back rode the
                    Devel with a monstrous Mask and horns to corispond, and drest in a black cloak.
                    Behind him rode (riding backwards both on a Horse) a lad with a pale Mask, and
                    in the utmost trembling and destress, to represent the fallen Emperor. Both
                    these perform'd their parts extreemly well, and cause'd the utmost laughter,
                        <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Inskip">Inskip</a> was Devil, and Jack
                    sombody was Bounaparte. It was the best Devil I ever saw, and riding thus like a
                    whipper-in after the parsons, had a strange and ridiculous appearance. A Bullock
                    drest in Ribbons, followd likewise by music, had marchd through the town two
                    days before and was now on the Spit, and in the pot, as dinner was to commence
                    at 4. A long range of Tables were placed from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Westons">Westons</a> door to the George, capable
                    of accommodating all the poor in the Town that is, all who labour for bread, the
                    whole was coverd with Canvass and form'd a compleat tent, border'd throughout by
                    garlands of flowers, and each table having a flag inscribe'd, '<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AlexanderTsar" title="Alexander">Alexander</a>', 'Blucher', 'Platoff'
                        &amp;c.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> At the end stood a kind of Maypole, bearing a gilded Cock,
                    surmounted by a flag—Across the center of the street was erected a stage for the
                    band, who had there a little bower of their own, above the passing carriages.—At
                    4 about 250 people sat down to dinner in the greatest good order. [small sketch
                    at the bottom left of the page with the words 'England' with the drawing of a
                    cock underneath and then the words 'of the walk' beneath that] At the head of
                    the Table sat <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilliamsonEdmund" title="Mr Williamson">Mr Williamson</a> and the other conductors of the feast took each of
                    them a Table, as president and carver, Here you might have seen two Doctors, two
                    publican's, a parson, and a Shopkeeper &amp;c &amp;c. in White Aprons,
                    slashing up the Beef and plumb pudding, and sharing out several Baskets of
                    potatoes.—The Town was crouded with spectators, and all was joy. At 6, (after
                    grace in due order) dinner was removed, and the Gentlemen part of the company
                    had a boarded stage for their wine and refreshments, and here; while men women
                    and children were Huzzaing around, they did just what must be expected, viz, got
                    drunk by drinking Toasts. The musical performers at one time did not know 'God
                    save the King,' from Jack's-alive; but this fervor subsided gradually so as to
                    produce no mischief, and to leave the evening for a still more singular
                    exhibition, which is the beautiful effect of light under boughs, which, as you
                    have now seen <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Vauxhall" title="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</a>, you can fully
                    understand. I should here tell you that in the evening Tea was serve'd on the
                    platform to all the women who choose it, and dancing commenced in the real
                    country stile. Miss Weston made more tea than she ever did in one day in her
                    life. Amongsts the flags <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#InskipThomas" title="Inskip">Inskip</a> had
                    two very large, inscribed 'The Strength of Kings is the Affections of the
                    people' and, 'Freedom to Slaves, and peace to the World'. Mr Walker had a real
                    fine transparency, and his house a croud of green and blossoms,—Mr Gay several
                    transparencies of his own painting, and his House shaded by Oak-limbs planted in
                    the street. Mr Radwell, Mr Betts &amp;c cut a conspicuous figure; so that
                    when I tell you that there was not a window in the town without Candles,
                    folliage, and flowers, you must try to guess at the effect. It made my eyes
                    water in spite of myself.—This first night's frolick was not all, though the
                    Town was not quiet till two in the morning.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> On Thursday—A Ball had been announced to be held at the White
                    Hart, to which were invited all the Respectable people round the neighbourhood,
                    and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> had been busily
                    employd with other scholars to write Notes of invitation. This whole day was
                    spent in mirth. Amongst the rest a large party, (in fact any who pleased) danced
                    to two fidlers on the platform, Young Girls 'threading the Needle along' the
                    Street, Boys kicking a Bladder; And more particularly a ridiculous scene, of a
                    Rope suspended upon poles, to which was tied by small twine two lumps of pudding
                    drip'd in treacle, under which stood on stools, two boys with their hands tied
                    behind them, whose business it was to catch the pudding in their mouths! I say
                    nothing of their faces! treacle betide us! what a mess. At Night about 40 Ladies
                    and as many Gentlemen danced at Barbers till morning, with fidlers from Bedford
                    and Nitshill &amp;c—Friday—Taylor the Sadler Chaird through the Town with
                    the Band, and the wife of our 'Old Richard' riding on a great thundering black
                    Horse coverd with a white sheet and flowers. This old woman litterally danced
                    all day from Wednesday morning till Friday night. On the Ball night <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WestonJoseph" title="Mr Weston">Mr Weston</a> ornamented his House with
                    Hop-vines from his Garden, intersperse'd with Lamps; with several transparencies
                    of his own designing, Saturday—The Townsmen presented a Flag to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#OsborneGeorge" title="Sir George Osborn">Sir George Osborn</a> in testimony of
                    his bounty towards this real and National holiday, which the good old man has
                    promise'd to presever and to leave to his grandchildren. &amp;c
                    &amp;c</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> And now Father how did you get through this bustle,? what did our
                    house look like? did not you want to help?</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I saw on Monday that I should 'be drag'd' and directly began to
                    regret that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> was not at
                    home to contrive and to help. 'I wish <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldHannah" title="Hannah">Hannah</a> was here' was repeated oftener than I ever repeated it before,
                    for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon" title="Charles">Charles</a> was busy at
                    writing, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a>
                    my only housemaid,—However I naild up lathes for the illuminatiion, sent for
                    Candles, Cockades, &amp;c—Joe Saunders procure'd a large bough of Oak, and
                    Old Squires two tall branches of Laurel;—Our three younkers went to Rowney and
                    lug'd home as much Yellow Broom and Cornflowers as they could carry, we set to
                    work, made them with form, and on Wednesday morning up at 6, I hung the outer
                    circle of the parlour window with a garland of flowers, naild a Rose-bush over
                    the door, trimd up <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry" title="Roberts">Roberts</a>
                    Hoop into a Garland and displayd it on a pole from the Landing window.—In the
                    evening lighted up about four score Candle, and remove'd your old Richard and
                        Kate<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> from the Mill, and with a White flag inscribed <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">peace</em> mounted them on one of Barber's Gin Kegs on a string inside the
                    parlour window, to the great amusement of the Boys. [a sketch of this below]</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Now my dear Girl you must absolutely come home <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">this week</em>, for though <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot" title="Charlotte">Charlotte</a> does all she

                    we have been starving upon bake'd Veal, Calve's Liver, Shoulder of Lamb and

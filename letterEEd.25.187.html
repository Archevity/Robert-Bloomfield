			  <h3>187. Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydBakerMary" title="Mary Lloyd Baker">Mary Lloyd                     Baker</a>, 2 June 1806<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">City Road June 2. 1806</p>
						
						<p class="pnonident">To Mrs L Baker </p>
						<p class="pnonident">Dear Madam</p>
						<p style="text-indent:40px;"> It happened that I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="your good cousin">your good cousin</a> on the very day                     on which you date yours from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Fulham" title="Fullham">Fullham</a>.                     With respect to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpCatherine" title="Miss Sharp's">Miss Sharp's</a>                     communication from Wicken, I made a delay and delay caused a blunder &amp;c.                     &amp;c. &amp;c.—to be accounted for hereafter either to that lady or to                     you. But so it is that I have sent the Books required not to Northampton shire                     but to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ClareHall" title="Clare Hall">Clare Hall</a>! I cannot help it,                     it is done! Your copy is amongst them—but now I am going to broach another                     subject for I am quite ashamed of this.—For your criticism I thank you and I                     find so much difficulty in even approaching to what pleases my self in Blank                     verse that you have no need to fear my relinquishing my jingle. Tell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpWilliam" title="your good father">your good father</a> that I have made                     some progress in the Wars of Troy, but that I shall want the Vollm the best part                     of the summer if he can spare it. It is all novelty, all charms, only a little                     too much blood. There's a critique upon Homer! What do you think of me!! I hope                     to see your scetches of Forest Trees, and if I might see your short poems <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">scribbled</em> in blank verse, though I know for a certainty                     that M.S. poetry is not read with the same advantage with that which is printed,                     I should feel highly honourd. If I exhibit my 'first view of the sea' it will be                     an effort on my part, for though it is actually printed in the 'Monthly Mirror,'                     I have such a distaste towards it as you can hardly conceive. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> it is very unequal to the
                    subject, what is the use of a man's saying that the Church in which Nelson was                     buried is bigger that [sic] the church at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Fulham" title="Fullham">Fullham</a> ? Let him <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">tell how big it is</em>! This I
                    could not do, and therefore do not like the piece, any more than you would a                     picture in which in the outline you had spoiled the perspective.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> If I understand you right you will probably be disengaged on                     Saturday afternoon, and if I understand <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">myself</em> right, I                     mean certainly to make my way to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Fulham" title="Fullham">Fullham</a>                     some time on that day, and to leave you on Monday or Tuesday at furthest. I feel                     just now as if I had a vast deal to talk about, but if I put it into a letter it                     will encroach on my teatime.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Can I conclude this hasty epistle without doing justice to my own                     feelings, and to the condescencion of the venerable landlord of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AustinWilliamUncle" title="my uncle">my uncle</a> the farmer, in saying  that about an hour ago I had the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Duke of Grafton">Duke of Grafton</a> in my little parlour, who with one of his sons calld                on me during their morning ride.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> More of all these matters anon—</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> Love to yours and to you</p><p align="right">R Bloomfield</p>

			  <p class="pnonident">Dear George </p>
			  
			  <p style="text-indent:40px;"> On account of the weather and other considerations, I dare not                     accept an invitation to take a cheap ride to Durham, which under other
                    circumstances would be delightful. It is an author traveling for statistical                     information and I don't know enough about him.—The account which I have received                     of our sister <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HingstonElizabeth" title="Bets">Bets</a> and which                     perhaps you have heard from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nat">Nat</a>,
                    is, that she is in a [illegible word] trade in Milinerary and Bonnets, works for                     a good [illegible word] he has a promising appearance as to business, and lives                     [illegible words]fth Street I have written to her and shall expect to hear from                     her as I trust that the conveyance will be strictly honourable; as I have                     address'd the letter inclosed to Mr Charles Wilson Peale, Museum, Philadelphia;                     who is father to the proprietor of the Mammoth, who with his Mammoth and his                     paintings is now at Bristol on his return to America, and who will most probably
                    cary the letter himself. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="back1"> </a></p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I have not received a farthing, for my <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#SealOffice" title="Seal Office">Seal Office</a> job. Nor seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenWilliam" title="Mr Allen">Mr Allen</a> but once since my return                     from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Woolwich" title="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>. I am highly gratified at                         <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft's">Mr Lofft's</a> calling on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a> because I know she                     would be gratified by it.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I ocasionally mend and make shoes for my family, and then write                     letters, compose, read, sing, sigh, nurse, &amp;c as the spirit                     dictates.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> You will find; I hope, that I have thus far endeavour'd manfully                     to get the pastoral noticed by the public, <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> but my introductions are crampt; and the public mind so                     engaged about War and Bloodshed that I begin to doubt much that the lowly and                     charming eloquence of that piece will never be heard. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> justly says that it would                     succeed <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">if it was</em> accepted by the managers, but I doubt                     that he is not aware of the difficulties to be overcome in getting it accepted:
                    there lies the point, nothing on my part shall be wanting either in walks or in                     impudence, at least more of it than I could use if the piece was my own.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:40px;"> I lately dined in company with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikenJohnEd" title="Dr Aikin">Dr Aikin</a> and his son <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikenArthur" title="Arthur">Arthur</a>, who is Editor of the Annual
                    Review, and who in that work by the bye, has given my neighbour <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HollowayWilliam" title="Holloway">Holloway</a> and some others a very                     indiferent 'character from their last place.' <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldNat" title="Nats">Nats</a> poems are not noticed there,                     nor mine of course; for they did not come into last year's literature. I was
                    anxious to see men so famous in the world of Books; But though <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RogersSamuel" title="Mr Rogers">Mr Rogers</a> at whose table we met                     behaved with his usual kindness <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikenJohnEd" title="Dr A">Dr A</a>                     and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikenArthur" title="Son">Son</a> would have known just as
                    much of me had I been looking through a gimblet hole in the wainscot, and I                     should have made as good a figure in the company. Neither of them ask'd one 
                    rest of the evening pride kindly came to my assistance and from that moment                     instead of feeling myself <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">little</em>, I grew to a most noble                     and patagonian <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> nature, from which I could scarcely
                    reduce myself for many days after; and which enabled me at the moment to turn a                    question of any kind nor gave a moment's chance for poor Giles to mix his mud                     with the unceasing stream of erudition that flowd copiously for four hours. I                     eat a good dinner, but soon found that I was in the wrong box. Yet, I was                     invited there and they were no more. Now all this might happen without any                     intention on their side. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikenJohnEd" title="Dr A.">Dr A.</a> drank                 to me in common on taking the first glass of wine; else I should have concluded           that he did not know I was there. They are professd Criticks, and perhaps they                     served me right for being among them; but if they will but pardon me this first                     time I will not offend again. During the first hour I felt pain, but during the
                    deaf ear to the contended merits of Demosthenes and Cicero, the Borhavians in            medicine, and the &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c—and to set and                     compose verses 'to my Old Oak table', which by the bye is a far better companion                     to me, as I will make appear, than <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikenJohnEd" title="Dr. A">Dr.                         A</a> and his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikenArthur" title="son">son</a> put        together. <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="back4"> </a> If they were
                    previously ofended with me or any one connected with me it is more than I know.                     If I did chance to smell of wax as I had been mending my Children's shoes in the                     morning I might be disagreeable without knowing it; but if a man invited to a                     neighbour's table finds there one inferior to him in knowledge and wealth, and                     takes care to let him see that he thinks so, my soul despises that man: and I                     had allmost said that God allmighty was jesting when he made him.—Pardon my                     warmth <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge" title="George">George</a> you know me. If                     this sees the daylight I shall have them about my ears.—Love to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GloverElizabeth" title="my Mother">my Mother</a> and to your Children</p>

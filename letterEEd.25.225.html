                        Baker</a>, 22 January 1808<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">City Road, London </p><p align="right">Jan 22. 1808</p><p class="pnonident">Dear Madam</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Thanks for your excellent letter.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I think that amongst all the pleasures we derive from Biography
                    that there is manifestly a great injustice done to the correspondents of those
                    who happen to have their letters collected and published. The poor poets
                    epistles are exhibited, but the epistles he <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">receives</em> are
                    kept out of sight, though such epistles perhaps were the chief agents in
                    eliciting the very thoughts and diction of his own. I am led into these
                    reflections from recently perusing <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobert" title="Southey's">Southey's</a> 'Remains of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke" title="H. K.White">H.
                        K.White</a>'.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> If you have not seen this masterly memoir and
                    contemplated the character of the person it celebrates you have a treat to come
                    which I should be sorry you should miss.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I lent <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrantAnne" title="Mrs Grant's">Mrs Grant's</a>
                    poems to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AnsteadMiss" title="Miss Ansted">Miss Ansted</a> who returned it
                    with the note and memorandum which you will find in the volum. I esteem the
                    notes to the poems, and the fine picture of Highland manners exhibited through
                    the work.<a href="#2"> [2]</a><a name="back2"> </a> Though, as
                    her letters are so good, I am not certain that her poetry will set her in a new
                    light to you, who have relished the prose first.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Your account of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CooperCharlotte" title="Miss Cooper">Miss
                        Cooper</a> is indeed a subject on which I have allmost got 'the horrors'.
                    You will see that I have ventured to write to her: having promised a tune which
                    I cannot get. Hers is a dangerous age, and liable to the seeds of decline. I
                    hope for all their sakes she will escape this bout, and take care of herself.
                    N.B. I have mentioned in my letter to her, nothing of you (<em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">cause</em> of her illness). I have sent her a song &amp;c.—</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> And now for the accompanying packet &amp;c—I have already
                    said that your book has given me much pleasure and amusement and I return it, I
                    hope, undamaged. With respect to what I have done from it, I wish to remind you
                    again that I never did but <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">one</em> copy in Indian Ink before I
                    had your Book, and therfore had some trouble, and found perseverance a highly
                    necessiry quality.* I have done them all by candlelight. You will find two or
                    three in your book which for different reasons I did not attempt, that of the
                    upstream end of Chepstow Castle I thought I never could do so as to satisfy
                    myself. The view in the Wye meadows is my worst—but it being but the second on
                    the list, and the view of Mitchel Dean the last, I keep up my courage boldly.
                    Have mercy on <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">my own</em> scratches from fancy, and be as
                    favourable as you can towards the two that I have done from <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">my</em> drawings on the spot. They are both erroneous in point of
                    perspective, and I have in many instances made the distances too dark.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The prose journal might be materially amended as to a <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">whole</em>, but I set no store by it but as a string of
                    memorandums. Some parts are obscure and some too much in <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">immediate</em> relation to yourself and friends, to be read <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">generally</em>. These I think are necessary provisos between you and I,
                    that you may not think that I have aimed at perfection. If you judge that my
                    book could give a moments pleasure to the Lasses of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#FerneyHill" title="Ferney Hill">Ferney Hill</a> let them see it, for the
                    more criticism I have on my attempts, the better I can feel my own ground. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> The frost is intensely severe and we are hovering over the fire
                    at the close of day. All well. I could, methinks, moralise over the situation of
                    those who have a scarcity of food and fuel!—You mention the pitiable situation
                    of such as spend sleepless hours in bed. This seldom falls to my lot, but my
                    sleep is, as I have often told you, full of the most hideous workings of fancy
                    whenever I am disturbed by vexation, or unwell. I am now happily free from
                    both.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I rather think that when this letter is gone I shall recollect
                    somthing or other which I meant to have said, but as it will not come to hand
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">now</em>, I only add my respects to all your house, and
                    particularly to the younger objects of your affection. What would you think of
                    having a ride in Powels Cart<a href="#3"> [3]</a><a name="back3"> </a> such a day as this?

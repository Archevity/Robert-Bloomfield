Robert Bloomfield to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Capel Lofft">Capel
                        Lofft</a>, 26 October [1801]<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><p align="right">Octo 26.</p><p class="pnonident">Sir,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> With expedition equal to your own, but with much less warmth, I
                    humbly beg to reply. It is an irksome task that I am oblidged to justify <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> against your groundless
                    suspicions. But however I may sink in your estimation I shall retain justice
                    enough to declare that I have not spoken to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> during the last 3 weeks, and <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">never</em> yet
                    heard one word from him on the subject of the present notes. Thus much is due to
                    him from me, and shall fearlessly be paid as the declaration of truth. Now then,
                    Sir, I am willing to take all your displeasure on myself. I am aware of the
                    difficulty of making the quartos differ from the pocket size, but I was not
                    aware that the mention of any subject connected with the work in hand, in the
                    channel of an intimate correspondence, would subject me to the hazard of being
                    discarded by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a>. I have reason
                    to rely on his judgment, and allways did; the concurrence of the public in his
                    judgment of the Farmer's Boy taught me to rely on it. Does it then follow, that,
                    if I learn that a dislike subsists in many minds to have my little pieces
                    prejudged, as they call it, that I am forbidden to say so? I never objected to
                    your praise, to my shame I speak it; I never objected personally to any applause
                    which anything of mine might draw from you. I only ventured to mention that <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">previous praise</em> did not please the readers, and that I
                    thought myself implicated in it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hoods">Mr
                        Hoods</a> name was not mentioned. The animosity between you and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodThomas" title="Mr Hood">Mr Hood</a> has proved always, as I said
                    it would, my severest trouble. It blocks up the field of fair discussion, stops
                    my mouth on all occasions where habits of intimacy would prompt me to tell what
                    I thought, and what I think. The nauseous task of telling who said that, and who
                    said this, I never will descend to. I have satisfied my own conscience in
                    endeavouring to state to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft">Mr. Lofft</a>
                    what I think concerns us both. I have no <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">personal</em> objection
                    to the notes, I never had. But if the disapprobation of even a small portion of
                    readers could be avoided, I repeat it, I did not think I was wrong in mentioning
                    it, though I felt that reluctance which I did. I did not <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">exclude</em><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft">Mr. Lofft</a> from writing any critique,
                    or appendix, or whatever he pleased; I said I should like to write something
                    myself by way of preface. What was the reply? 'It is very proper that you
                    should.' I then thought that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a>
                    would have done the same in his own way, and when the proof of the preface was
                    returned without, I was disappointed that he had not, and wished that I had said
                    expressly that the proofs had been revised by him. So much for excluding <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft">Mr. Lofft</a> from my poor publication. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> If I felt that I deserved these severe censures, I should be
                    miserable; as I know that I do not, my mind shall be easy come what will. To
                    write my thoughts I see is impossible without lessening that high opinion which
                    has been professed for me. I have been extravagantly applauded; few men have had
                    a severer trial. My <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modesty</em> have been extoll'd; my
                    insolence shall not take place of it in any ones mind, unless what I now write
                    be so termd. I feel my situation to be novel; the world looks at me in that
                    light. I am extreemly anxious on that account. I do not pretend to know how
                    strong a negative in any case my author's prerogative ought to give me. I have
                    formerly used it with much greater chance of offending (as I thought) than I did
                    now. Now, I only suggested; formerly I dictated (in the 'imagination'), <a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> and still I was not given up. If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> and I could change places we
                    might feel each other's convictions stronger; and I assure <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> that he might safely enter
                    upon the trial, and would have to endure no compunctions, no remorse for the sin
                    of ingratitude, no consciousness of having forfeited one tittle of the character
                    voluntarily given him by those who have a right to watch over the peculiarities
                    of his mind, and the dawnings of his ambition, lighted and fann'd by themselves. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> With these sentiments, never in my life thinking higher of my own
                    purity of principle, I beg to be, sir, with all due and unabated respect,</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Yours, &amp;c.</p><p align="right">Bloomfield</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> If the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3" title="Duke of Grafton">Duke
                            of Grafton</a> calls at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Troston" title="Troston">Troston</a>, and my name should be mentioned, it may be more than I
                        deserve. But if I had made any <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">private communication</em> I
                        should indeed be that scoundrel which I am becoming in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft's">Mr. Lofft's</a> account.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> If the trouble given by the revisal of my publication has
                        robbed <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> of one pleasure,
                        it will cast a gloom over that train of thinking in my mind; but I shall
                        never be ungrateful. </p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add. MS 28268, ff. 62–63;

                        Lofft</a>, 22 October 1801<a href="#*">*</a><a name="back*"> </a></h3><div xmlns="" class="epigraph"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">(Extract)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="right">Extract of a Letter sent to Mr Lofft</p></div><p align="right">Oct. 22d, 1801.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I cannot forbear mentioning a subject that have troubled me for a
                    month past, during which time I have hesitated about daring to broach it. In the
                    notes of approbation which you have attached to each piece in the Vollm now
                    printing, a praise too direct, if not premature, is made to meet the publick eye.<a href="#1"> [1]</a><a name="back1"> </a> 
                        These notes, Sir, will be disapproved, I know they will. I wish sincerely they had been                     concentrated in another form at the end of the volm, and not, as in their
                    present situation, appearing to lead the reader to a determination which he, no                    doubt, would rather have to flow from his own judgment than from that of any man                     whatever. If it is ask'd, what possible detriment can it be to the author? I                     answer, that if it be known that he saw the proofs, and permitted such <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">direct praise</em> to pass him; it may, and will be said, that
                    'he is not very averse to flattery, if he can deceive himself into a belief of                     the justness of such applause <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">before the public has seen this
                        second attempt</em>.' And thus involved in the censure of the many, he may
                    wish in vain that he had had courage to vote against it.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> Your motive is for my good, no one will doubt it. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I am certainly proud of the approbation of such a man as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames" title="Mr Fox">Mr Fox</a>, and should be glad that
                    the publick should know it, as well as that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> gave an entire approbation of what he was laying before
                    them. But I wish it had been in a more unaccceptionable shape.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> I beg of you to consider it, and to make the notes stand at the
                    end in the Quartos and Octavos now printing, as they will meet the publick eye
                    first. Nay, I will venture further, and say, that such a declaration in my
                    favour from my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr Lofft">Mr Lofft</a> would
                    have had a tenfold weight in a second edition (should it be required) than thus
                    to assume the appearance of judging for the reader, and thereby destroying that
                        <em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fair trial</em> of opinion which the pieces would otherwise
                    experiance. I wish the subject had been started before the printing had begun;
                    but I did not then feel myself implicated as I now know that I am, and shall
                    be.</p><p style="text-indent:40px;"> This is a delicate subject; and I think <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LofftCapel" title="Mr. Lofft">Mr. Lofft</a> will not urge any thing to
                    hurt my feelings instead of being grateful and pleasing. </p><p style="text-indent:40px;"><em xmlns="" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Every body</em> who have seen the pieces, either in MS. or in
                    the proofs, are uniform in this opinion, but no one will tell you so but myself.
                    I shall call this 'my humble remonstrance and petition,' and trusting to your
                    candor, remain, &amp;c.</p><p align="right">Bloomfield.</p></div><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"><h3>Notes</h3></div><div class="note"><p class="letnote2"><a name="*">*  </a>BL Add. MS 28268, f. 58;
